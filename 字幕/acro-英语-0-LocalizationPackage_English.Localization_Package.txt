!*Don’t confuse this place with the Old North Church – it’s actually a completely different building, which is why it has a different name. This particular meeting house was for the second oldest congregation in Boston, which earned it the alternate name "The Second Church". What an age of endless imagination this was. <br><br>Get a good look while you can – this wooden building will be torn down in 1776 and used as firewood. The church members would tell you it was because the British didn’t like them much – and perhaps they have a point, because they still don’t.  The Reverend, Mr. Lathrop, was known for his pro-Rebel sermons and tellingly, he and most of his congregation weren’t in Boston in 1776. I wonder why. After the Old North Meeting House was torn down, Christ Church inherited the prestigious ‘Old North’ title, becoming the “Old North Church” that most people know.

!*KING'S CHAPEL

Id: [0x00058211]
!*King James II ordered the building of this Anglican Church in the 1680s, because he was a King, and a perk of the job is doing whatever they want. However, since Boston was full of Puritans who had come to the New World precisely to get away from the Anglicans, nobody was willing to sell land to the budding parish. <br><br>In the end, the governor ordered that the church be built on top of the old public burial ground, the logic being that the dead couldn't complain – they’re notoriously compliant. And there the church stands today. <br><br>After the revolution, the church was known as “The Stone Chapel” for several years – Kings not being particularly popular at the time, and calling a stone chapel “The Stone Chapel” was the best idea anyone could come up with at the time.<br><br>(I’ve never understood these people’s need for independence, by the way. We gave birth to them, they were happy to suckle on our teats in their infancy, there were a few toddler wobbles but as soon as they got to their teenage years all they could bang on about was their independence. So they stormed out, but we know they’ll be back eventually to borrow money or to get us to wash their clothes, and we’ll forgive them, because we are older and wiser.)

Id: [0x00058212]
!*CHRIST CHURCH

Id: [0x00058213]
!*This is known today as "Old North Church", because it's the oldest church in the North End of Boston, but up to 1776 it would have been known by its official name, Christ Church, named after Jesus Christ, a former celebrity carpenter. <br><br>This is where, on the night of Paul Revere's ride, two signal lanterns appeared to warn rebels on the opposite shore that the British Regulars were on their way to seize weapons.  The signal was Paul Revere's idea, but contrary to popular belief the lamps weren't a signal sent to Revere. They were meant to warn lookouts on the opposite shore in case Revere was captured. <br><br>This church was a natural choice for a signal flame: it was the highest steeple in Boston and easily seen from the other side of the river.  Even better, the church was Anglican - the congregation was full of wealthy Loyalists. Who would suspect the church sexton (Robert Newman, a friend of Revere's) of sneaking into the church at night to send secret messages?<br><br>Well, the British would, actually. They captured Newman a few days later and questioned him. He put on a terrific show, and managed to convince them he was innocent - and then fled town, which didn’t really back up the whole ‘innocent’ thing very well at all.

!*OLD SOUTH MEETING HOUSE

Id: [0x00058215]
!*This building hosted some of the key events in the American Revolution, mostly by accident. It just happened to be one of the largest buildings in Boston. So, when meetings at Faneuil Hall overflowed, everyone moved to the Old South Meeting House to continue.  This meant the biggest, angriest, most rebellious crowds ended up here.<br><br>After the Boston Massacre, the people met here to demand that the Governor remove British troops from the city - which he did. Thousands showed up here for meetings leading up to the Boston Tea Party. On the night of the tea party itself, this was where Samuel Adams delivered the line "This meeting can do nothing more to save the country", giving the go-ahead to seize the boats and dump the tea. Is anything a bigger slap in the face to a Brit than dumping tea? No. Well, apart from just slapping us in the face, but that’s a secret I wish I hadn’t told you.<br><br>Of course, during the British siege in 1776, this church met the same fate as other rebel hotspots: it was ransacked.  The pews and pulpit were torn out and used as firewood, and the interior was filled with dirt and used as a stable and riding school. There was even a bar on the second level. I guess the troops thought that would really stick it to the Puritans. The only thing worse would have been a karaoke night. Puritans hate karaoke.

!*NEW SOUTH MEETING HOUSE

Id: [0x00058217]
!*Another wooden church, this time with a bell in the steeple. Samuel Adams' father (Also named Samuel Adams) was one of the founding members.  I'm surprised it wasn't torn down for firewood during the siege, but I guess its members just hadn't angered the British enough for that.<br><br>It's conveniently named so you won't mistake it for the Old South Meeting house, where all the important events happened. Simple is best. <br><br>(I’m describing the naming system – I’m not describing you.)

Id: [0x00058218]
!*OLD MEETING HOUSE

Id: [0x00058219]
!*The bells in this church rang out in the hours leading up to the Boston Massacre, as crowds were gathering to taunt the soldiers in front of the State House. In Boston at the time, church bells were rung when there was a fire, so people ran into the streets to see what was happening. That swelled the crowd, making tensions between the people and the British soldiers that much worse.  It ended, of course, with the soldiers firing into the crowd, killing 5 people.<br><br>And this concludes our lesson on how church bells could be used to incite riots in Colonial America.

!*GREEN DRAGON TAVERN

Id: [0x0005821B]
!*This tavern is sometimes called the "Headquarters of the Revolution", though I imagine when it is, they pronounce it “Headquartersh of the Revolushun”, because overthrowing the government in a pub is thirsty work.<br><br>It was a popular place for people like Paul Revere and Samuel Adams to sit with their friends and plot.<br><br>Up until 1754, the tavern was owned by William Douglass. When he died, his property was left to his daughter, Catherine Kerr, and his nephew, Cornelius Douglass. They divided their inheritance equally - and it seems, got along famously.<br><br>The Freemasons bought the tavern in 1766 and renamed it "The Freemasons Arms", which didn't actually stick because the sign above the door was still a Green Dragon. (Freemasons: the secret society everyone knows about. “Let’s get a pub where we can meet in complete secret and no one will ever know!” – “Brilliant! What shall we call it?” – “How about the Freemasons Arms?”) <br><br>Legend has it that Paul Revere's ride was planned here, but that's unlikely. By 1774 Revere had been warned that the British were listening in on his meetings and had therefore stopped making Super Secret Plans in public where anyone could hear them.<br><br>Someone tell the Masons. You know where to find them.

!*CROWN COFFEE HOUSE

Id: [0x0005821D]
!*The name of this place is somewhat misleading. It's likely that this 'coffee house' sold more wine than coffee, since coffee was only just becoming popular. I know it's hard to imagine a time when people didn't enjoy their morning cup, but there you are.<br><br>If we go by the number of bottles they had in stock, this was one of the busiest taverns in Boston - likely because of its location. If you were arriving in Boston by ship in the 1700s – and let’s face it, you didn’t fly in - this would have been the first tavern you saw, and since taverns were great places to get information, you might well have stopped here for a drink and the latest news.

Id: [0x0005821E]
!*BUNCH OF GRAPES

Id: [0x0005821F]
!*This was one of the meeting places of the Sons of Liberty. The attraction of this particular tavern may have been the library, which included many anti-British books. Or it might have been its reputation as the finest punch-house in Boston. Or it might even have been its location, which is right down the street from the Old State House, where the legislature met (and where the Boston Massacre occurred). Or it might have been Darts Night.<br><br>While I'd love to use the fact that the Patriots met in taverns to imply all kinds of things about them, I should point out that taverns were places to do business as well as drink, and that alcohol was viewed as (more or less) the cure for all ills.  (You're waiting for a punch line, but that's actually true. Those are the kind of doctor’s orders I crave.)

!*OLD STATE HOUSE

Id: [0x00058221]
!*This building housed the Massachusetts government from 1713 to 1798. Before the revolution, that would have meant the governor, his advisors, and the elected assembly. Of course, by 'elected', I mean 'elected by white male property-owners' since they were the only people that had the right to vote.<br><br> The assembly also had rather limited power - the governor had a veto over anything they decided, and on occasion dissolved the assembly when they didn't vote his way. Less a governor, more a dictator.<br><br>In 1767 a gallery was installed above the meeting floor here so the general public could watch their legislature at work - this was a very novel idea at the time. Of course, some of the representatives probably regretted the decision later, when crowds used the area to heckle those who voted pro-British. Then again, perhaps that was the point all along.<br><br>The government moved out of the building to a bigger space in 1798 and the old building was turned over to merchants, including a wine seller and a wig-maker, making it the colonial equivalent of a shopping mall, though one that mainly dealt in wine and wigs.

!*FANEUIL HALL

Id: [0x00058223]
!*Don't let the French spelling confuse you. The name of this building is pronounced "Fan-yul or "Fannel". Getting it wrong is a good way to indicate you're not from around here, but it’s also a great way of proving you’re not French, which in my experience is a real boon.<br>  <br>Also, if you want to pass as a local, you should take a good look at the weathervane. It's a Boston landmark. Legend has it that in the war of 1812, suspected spies were asked what was on top of Faneuil Hall. Only a true local would be able to say it was a grasshopper.<br><br>The building was named after Peter Faneuil, the local merchant who paid to build it. It was meant as a place for local farmers to sell their goods so their carts would stop crowding the streets, and also so you didn’t have to walk near farmers.<br><br>However, it's the meeting hall on the second floor, which gives the building its nickname "The Cradle of Liberty". That's rather ostentatious - and dare I say, American - as a nickname, but it's not inaccurate. People met here to protest the Stamp Act. The first anti-tea tax meetings were also held here. Anti-British meetings occasionally drew crowds so large the building couldn't even hold them (at which point they all went to the Old South Meeting Hall).<br><br>During the siege of Boston, the meeting hall here was made over into a theatre. Since plays of any kind were banned in Boston under ordinary circumstances – something I think should still be a law, actually - this is yet another example of the British Loyalists sticking it to the rebels.

!*PAUL REVERE HOUSE

Id: [0x00058225]
!*Paul Revere lived in this house with his family from 1770 until about 1800, with some notable exceptions (such as when he had to lie low because he'd warned the countryside of the British march on Lexington and Concord.) <br><br>What with the shortage of firewood in 1776, and the Loyalist insistence on getting back at anyone who'd defied them in the past, you'd think this wooden house might have been torn down too, but it wasn't. This might be because Revere left his eldest son (also named Paul) in town to watch over the estate. <br><br>In any event, the building is still around today- one of Revere's descendants bought it in 1905 and turned it into a museum. It's now the oldest building in Boston - in fact, it was already 90 years old when Revere bought it. Colonial architecture is apparently superior to that of your average McMansion.

!*OLD CORNER BOOK STORE

Id: [0x00058227]
!*It's an apothecary shop at the moment, but in a few decades this building will be home to Ticknor and Fields, the leading American publisher of their day. That might sound a bit dull, but this building will be at the centre of American literature and thinking. Authors like Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Nathaniel Hawthorne Harriet Beecher Stowe, even Charles Dickens will all meet here.<br><br>Of course, given the state of American education, it's possible you don't know who any of those people are. I could have said Minty Clitheroe and Pippy BoomBoom and you’d still have looked impressed.

!*MILL POND

Id: [0x00058229]
!*This is the site of Boston's first - and for a good while, only - flour mill. The Mill owners closed this pond off from the Charles River, leaving only a small stream that led to the ocean. Twice a day, the tides in Boston Harbour would fill the stream, powering the mill.<br><br>Of course, closing the pond off also made it stagnant. Since water was used as a dumping ground for sewage, garbage and dead animals, it was quite dirty and frankly, stank. <br><br>Around the turn of the century the city decided that something needed to be done. Rather than re-open the causeway and clean out the pond, developers decided they could make room for houses (and also more money) by filling it in with land taken from the top of Beacon Hill. So, that's exactly what they did. Building homes on sewage since the turn of the century! What a wonderful slogan that would have made.

Id: [0x0005822A]
!*BEACON HILL

Id: [0x0005822B]
!*Perhaps predictably, Beacon Hill gets its name because the Puritan settlers placed a beacon on the hilltop. 'Beacon' here essentially meant 'a bucket full of pitch hanging from a pole'. The idea being it could be lit to warn the countryside if the town was attacked - simple, effective, and never actually used. <br><br>The hill is shorter today than it used to be - the top of it was carted off to fill in Mill Pond. This had the advantage of making the hilltop easier to build on, and creating more land at Mill Pond - a 2-for-1 deal for developers.<br><br>Beacon Hill became THE place to live in Boston after the new Massachusetts State House opened here in 1790. Developers created upscale housing on the south side of the hill, which overlooks the Boston Common.  <br><br>The North side of the hill had been settled earlier, and was much less posh, sometimes going by the evocative nickname of 'Mount Whoredom'. What a magical address. George Washington, ever the politician, would refer to it in one of his letters as "Mount Horam" - though that sounds more like an instruction than a place.

!*BOSTON LIGHT

Id: [0x0005822D]
!*This was the first lighthouse in North America, built to help guide ships into Boston harbour at night. Of course, this made it a prime target for the revolutionaries during the siege of Boston. They attacked and burned the building. When the British began to repair it, they returned and burned it again.<br><br>Of course, the British did them one better - when they left Boston harbour in 1776, they blew up the entire lighthouse behind them. It was a very confusing time to be a lighthouse fan. Do I like them? Don’t I like them? I felt the same way about light jazz.<br><br>A new lighthouse was built in 1783, so it persists and survives, despite all efforts to destroy it. <br><br>Much like light jazz.

!*MACNEAL'S ROPE YARD

Id: [0x0005822F]
!*These buildings were used to make rope for ship rigging. Please try and stay awake. Ships at the time needed a surprising amount of rope - up to 20 miles of the stuff each, which you’ll realize is incredible, if you're a rope nerd.<br><br>Ahem. <br><br>This’ll wake you up. Rope isn't the real reason this place is well-known (among historians, I mean.) In March of 1770, one of the workers here asked a passing British soldier if he wanted a job, then told him to "go clean my shithouse". The soldier was so offended that he started a fight. Then he left, came back with several of his friends and started a full-on brawl.  That one insult led to days of fighting between soldiers and rope workers - leading right up to the Boston Massacre.<br><br>The relationship between the British and Bostonians at the time was... a little tense, to say the least. History does not reveal if that worker ever had his shithouse cleaned, but it seems unlikely.

!*BOSTON COMMON

Id: [0x00058231]
!*This has the honour of being the first public park in North America. It started off as the pasture of William Blackstone (or Blaxton, if you prefer the original spelling), who despite his name was the first white settler in this area. When Boston started growing, Blackstone decided to move somewhere more remote. He sold the land to the growing city for £30, and they turned it into common land - hence the name.<br><br>For the first century or two of Boston's history this was a place to pasture your cows (no more than 70 at a time), drill soldiers (the British Regulars camped here) attend the occasional public hanging (for offenses such as being a witch, or being a Quaker), or perhaps simply take a nice walk… near all the cows and hanging.<br><br>The British left the camp when the fled the city in 1776. Public hangings ended in 1817. The cows were banned in 1830. You can still take a walk here, however, but what’s the point, without the cows?

!*LIBERTY TREE

Id: [0x00058233]
!*The first protest over the Stamp Act met under this tree in August of 1765.  Shortly afterward, a plaque was nailed to the tree calling it the "Liberty Tree". Some say the name was meant to discourage violence from the crowds that met here, but that would be like naming a battlefield HappyGlade Smile-Farm and just crossing your fingers. Eventually, a flag pole was installed in the tree, and the flag flown to summon people to meetings.<br><br>Unpopular figures were hung in effigy from the tree's branches. The Sons of Liberty also used to issue "Summons" to the tree for supposed crimes (i.e. supporting unpopular British decrees, like the Stamp Act and Tea Act). <br><br>The idea caught on elsewhere - other towns designated their own liberty trees, or put up liberty poles. In New York there was an ongoing battle between the Sons of Liberty - who kept putting the poles up - and the British Authority - who kept taking them down, like an angry couple who can’t decide whether the toilet seat should be up or down.<br><br>True to the British penchant for destroying anything the Rebels loved, soldiers and Loyalists chopped down this tree during the siege in 1775. It was used as firewood, which was in short supply. Modern Day Boston has a plaque over the tree's former location, but the tree itself has never been replaced. So much for environmental sustainability.

!*Stephane Chapheau

Id: [0x0005A14A]
!*Stephane Chapheau is a Boston militiaman, and served as a cook in the years leading up to the revolution.<br><br>Chapheau was born in what's now Canada - near modern-day Montreal. His father was a cook for the French army who was killed in the fighting at the Plains of Abraham. After his death, Chapheau took on work as a chef in Montreal, but moved to Boston in 1764. While his personal letters indicate he was looking for a less complicated life, he was just in time for the unrest that preceded the Revolution. Fortunately for Chapheau, he didn't actually want a quiet life - and as it happened, the tensions in pre-Revolution Boston suited him exactly. Which is weird, because who enjoys tensions? Apart from a scientist studying surface tension as an effect of intermolecular attraction!!!<br><br>Give me a minute to stop laughing.<br><br>Chapheau was a man in search of a cause, and he found it in the Patriots. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the Sons of Liberty - participating in their 1765 protests surrounding the Stamp Act. He was present when the crowds ransacked Governor Hutchinson's house in 1765 - probably egging on the mob. He was also one of the crowd that witnessed (and partially caused) the Boston Massacre. <br><br>Chapheau didn't limit himself to protests. I have several fines for him on the books in the 1760s and 70s for public drunkenness, and brawling - it seems he couldn't keep out of a fight when the opportunity arose - and in pre-revolution Boston, there was always an opportunity. It was a wonderful time to be an angry drunk – the world was your oyster.

!*Duncan Little

Id: [0x0005A14C]
!*Duncan Little was originally from Ireland, the youngest son of a large family, which is confusing, seeing as they were the Little family. He entered the priesthood at a young age, and was sent to Africa as a missionary in 1756.<br><br>Little spent several years in Africa, but in 1760 he returned to Ireland, leaving the priesthood entirely - I'd tell you why, but it seems that information is locked behind a wall at the Vatican and I'm not hacking into their records today as they seem to have changed their password from W3L0V3P0P3 again. The next information I have about him is as a passenger on a ship to Boston in 1763. From his letters, it seems his family more or less drove him away over his split with the Catholic Church. (Blood being thicker than water and all of that.) <br><br>Little settled in Boston's North End, where he gained a reputation as a mediator - more fair and less expensive than going before the local judiciary. When he wasn't spending time at the local pub, he was helping people to solve their problems - generally by talking them down from a fight, which seems to be all that really happened in Boston in those days. And by those days, I mean anything up to the present day.  Little was the first person people called when there was a scuffle, and his usual table at the King's Horse tavern was known locally as "Little's Court" - a moniker the British cracked down on in 1770. Because we like to ruin everyone's fun.

!*Clipper Wilkinson

Id: [0x0005A14E]
!*Clipper Wilkinson is a hunter and surveyor from Virginia. Actually, surveying and hunting are the family business. His father and brother are surveyors (and crack shots) as well - making the market in his small hometown somewhat oversaturated. Hell, making the market in his HOUSE somewhat oversaturated.<br><br>Wilkinson moved to New York looking for work - unfortunately arriving just in time for the opening events of the Revolution. He remained neutral for the first part of the war, but after seeing the cruelty of the Redcoats' actions in Boston, he started leaning toward the rebel side - putting himself at odds with the rest of his family, who are Loyalists.<br><br>It seems Connor has a talent for attracting friends with family troubles.

!*Deborah 'Dobby' Carter

Id: [0x0005A150]
!*Deborah Carter was a courier in New York City at the time of the Revolution. She's the daughter of a merchant, Amos Carter, who was locally known for owning and bankrupting numerous businesses, and racking up significant debts.<br><br>Deborah was turned onto the streets at the age of 10 and took up work as an errand-runner, disguising herself as a boy to do it (hence the nickname 'Dobby'). Many of the tradesmen she worked for knew who she really was, but pretended to be fooled by the disguise. Possibly at first because they understood that her other options were limited, but later because she was quick, reliable and intelligent. <br><br>As a teenager, "Dobby" had to drop her disguise - but she kept her nickname. She continued her career carrying messages - and began negotiating contracts between businesses. She became something of a community icon - making sure the poor in the neighbourhood had food and clothing, and fighting against merchants who were charging exorbitant prices for staple items – a bit like Robin Hood, though when Dobby wore tights, no one giggled. And it was as a community icon that she met Connor.<br><br>Incidentally, I'm not being completely figurative when I say she was 'fighting' merchants. She wasn't averse to throwing a punch or two when it was necessary, particularly in her own defense - or the defense of others in her neighbourhood.

!*Jacob Zenger

Id: [0x0005A152]
!*Jacob Zenger was born near the town of Mannheim, in what is today Southwestern Germany.  He's the son of a farmer, one of 13 siblings. (Seems like a lot by modern standards, but colonial families were large, and the sad truth is that only 4 of Jacob's brothers and sisters would survive to adulthood.)<br><br>Zenger's family was poor and his career prospects were limited in Mannheim. Following the promise of a better life, he signed up as a soldier.  After several years in the service, he was shipped to New York - one of the Hessians sent to fight for the British in the Revolution. <br><br> Zenger - like many of the Hessian troops - left the service after coming overseas. Eager to get back to the country, Zenger bought a plot of land and left New York. However, after a series of crop failures, he was forced to move back to the city, taking up the only career that he could find to pay the bills - working as a bodyguard.

!*Jamie Colley

Id: [0x0005A154]
!*Jamie Colley is the son of a New York dock worker - James Colley. History doesn't record the name of his mother, though the Assassin records note she worked on a plantation in the southern colonies. <br><br>As a boy, Colley spent 3 years as a student at the Trinity School, where he was reported to be a bright student, reading everything he could get his hands on - his instructors noted that he was destined for great things. (I know you're wondering: yes, your school's permanent record really is that permanent). However, after that brief period he disappears from the school's attendance rolls - my guess would be he left because he needed to start earning money.  <br><br>It seems Colley's prospects didn't much improve through his teenage years - I have records of him being fined for vagrancy several times, which is never the sign of a high-flier. After that, he worked doing odd jobs for various local businesses, finally ending up working for a local physician, where his intelligence was recognized as an asset. He worked for several years as the doctor's assistant, where he met Connor.

!*Courteous Reader,<br><br>I might in this place attempt to gain thy Favour, by declaring that I write Almanacks with no other View than that of the publick Good; but in this I should not be sincere; and Men are now adays too wise to be deceiv’d by Pretences how specious foever.  The plain Truth of the Matter is, I am excessive ppor, and my Wife, good Woman, is, I tell her, excessive proud; she cannot bear, she says, to sit spinning in her Shift of Tow, while I do nothing but gaze at the Stars ; and has threatned more than once to burn all my Books and Rattling-Traps (as she calls my Instruments) if I do not make some profitable Use of them for the good of my Family.  The Printer has offer’d me some considerable share of the Profits, and I have thus begun to comply with my Dame’s desire.<br><br>Indeed this Motive would have had Force enough to have made me publish an Almanack many Years since, had it not been overpower’d by my Regard for my good Friend and Fellow-Student, Mr. Titan Leeds, whose Interest I was extreamly unwilling to hurt: But this Obstacle (I am far from speaking it with Pleasure) is soon to be removed, since inexorable Death, who was never known to respect Merit, has already prepared the mortal Dart, the fatal Sister has already extended her destroying Shears, and that ingenious Man must soon be taken from us.  He dies, by my Calculation made at his Request, on Oct. 17. 1733. 3ho. 29m. P.M. at the very instant of the Conjunction of Sol and Mercury; By his own Calculation he will survive till the 26th of the same Month. This small difference between us we have disputed whenever we have met these 9 Years past; but at length he is inclinable to agree with my Judgment; Which of us is most exact, a little Time will now determine.  As therefore these Provinces may not longer expect to see any of his Performances after this year, I think my self free to take up the Tas, and request a share of the publick Encouragement; which I am the more apt to hope for on this Account that the Buyer of y Almanack may consider himself, not only as purchasing an useful Utensilf, but as performing an Act of Charity, to his poor Friend and Servant<br>R SAUNDERS<br><br>XI Mon.

!*Loving Readers, <br><br>Your kind acceptance of my former labours has encouraged me to continue writing, tho' the general approbation you have been so good as to favour me with, has excited the envy of some, and drawn upon me the malice of others. These illwillers of mine, despited at the great reputation I gain'd by exactly predicting another man's death, have endeavoured to deprive me of it all at once in the most effectual manner, by reporting that I myself was never alive. They say, in short, that there is no such a man as I am; and have spread this notion so thoroughly in the country, that I have been frequently told it to my face by those that don't know me. This is not civil treatment, to endeavour to deprive me of my very being, and reduce me to a non-entity in the opinion of the publick. But so long as I know myself to walk about, eat, drink and sleep, I am satisfied that there is really such a man as l am, whatever they may say to the contrary. And the world may be satisfied likewise, for if there was no such man as I am, how is it possible I should appear publickly to hundreds of people, as I have done for several years past, in print? I need not, indeed, have taken any notice of so idle a report, if it had not been for the sake of my printer, to whom my enemies are pleased to ascribe my productions; and who it seems is as unwillingly to father my offspring as I am to lose the credit of it. Therefore, to clear him entirely, as well as to vindicate my own honour, I make this publick and serious declaration, which I desire may be believed, to wit: That what I have written heretofore, and do now write, <br>neither was, nor is written by any other man or men, per son or persons, whatsoever. <br>Those who are not satisfied with this, must needs be very unreasonable. <br><br>My performance for this year follows; it submits itself, kind reader, to thy censure, but hopes (for) thy candor, to forgive its faults. It devotes itself entirely to thy service, and will serve thee faithfully. And if it has the good fortune to please its master, 'tis gratification enough for the labour of <br>Poor<br>R. SAUNDERS<br><br>Presumptuous man! the reason would'st thou find <br>Why formed so weak, so little, and so blind? <br>First, if thou canst, the harder reason guess, <br>Why formed no weaker, blinder, and no less? <br>Ask of thy Mother Earth, why Oaks are made <br>Taller or stronger than the Weeds they shade? <br>Or ask of yonder argent Fields above, <br>Why Jove's Sattelites are less than Jove? <br><br>XI Mon. January hath xxxi days.<br><br>Some have learn't many Tricks of sly Evasion, <br>Instead of Truth they use Equivocation, <br>And eke it out with mental Reservation, <br>Which to good Men is an Abomination. <br>Our Smith of late most wonderfully swore, <br>That whilst he breathed he would drink no more,;<br>But since, I know his Meaning, for I think <br>He meant he would not breathe whilst he did drink <br><br>He is no clown that drives the plow, but he that doth clownish things. <br>If you know how to spend less than you get, you have the philosopher's-stone <br>The good pay-master is lord of another man's purse <br>Fish and visiters smell in three days. <br><br>XII Mon. February hath xxix days.<br><br>Sam's wife provok'd him once; he broke her Crown, <br>The surgeon's Bill amounted to Five Pounds; <br>This Blow (she brags) has cost my Husband dear, <br>He'll ne'er strike more, Sam chanc'd to overhear. <br>Therefore, before his Wife the Bill he pays, <br>And to the surgeon in her hearing, says: <br>Doctor, you charge Five pound, here e'en take Ten, <br>My Wife may chance to want your Help again. <br><br>He that has neither fools nor beggars among his kindred, is the son of thunder-gust. <br>Diligence is the mother of good luck. <br>Do not do that which you would not have known. <br><br>I Mon. March hath xxxi days.<br><br>Whate'er's desired, Knowledge, Fame, or Pelf, <br>Not one will change his Neighbour with himself ; <br>The learn'd are happy Nature to explore, <br>The Fool is happy that he knows no more. <br>The Rich are happy in the Plenty given ; <br>The Poor contents him with the Care of Heav’n. <br>Thus does some Comfort ev'ry State attend, <br>And Pride's bestowed on all, a common Friend. <br><br>Never praise your Cyder or Horse, or Bedfellow<br>Wealth is not his that has it, but his that enjoys it. <br>'Tis easy to see, hard to foresee. <br>In a discreet man's mouth a publick thing is private. <br><br>II Mon. April hath xxx days<br><br>By nought is Man from Beast distinguished, <br>More than by Knowledge in his learned Head, <br>Then Youth improve thy Time, but cautious see <br>That what thou learnest somehow useful be; <br>Each Day improving, Solon waxed old; <br>For Time he knew was better far than Gold: <br>Fortune might give him Gold which would decay, <br>But Fortune cannot give him — Yesterday. <br><br>Let thy maid-servant be faithful, strong, and homely. <br>Keep flax from fire, youth from gaming. <br>Bargaining has neither friends nor relations. <br>Admiration is the daughter of ignorance. <br>There's more old drunkards, than old doctors. <br><br>III Mon. May hath xxxi days.<br><br>Lalus who loves to hear himself discourse, <br>Keeps talking still as if he frantick were, <br>And tho' himself might no where hear a worse, <br>Yet he no other but himself will hear. <br>Stop not his Mouth, if he be troublesome, <br>But stop his Ears, and then the Man is dumb. <br><br>Here comes Courage! that seiz’d the lion absent, and run away from the present mouse. <br>He that takes a wife takes care. <br>Nor Eye in a letter, nor Hand in a purse, nor Ear in the secret of another. <br>He that buys by the penny, maintains not only himself, but other people. <br><br>IV Mon. June hath xxx days.<br><br>Things that are bitter, bitterer than Gall, <br>Physicians say are always physical : <br>Now Women's Tongues if into Powder beaten, <br>May in a Potion or a Pill be eaten, <br>And as there's nought more bitter, I do muse, <br>That Women's Tongues in Physick they ne'er use. <br>My self and others who lead restless Lives, <br>Would spare that bitter Member of our Wives. <br><br>He that can have Patience can have what he will. <br>Now I have a sheep and a cow, every body bids me good morrow. <br>God helps them that help themselves. <br>Why does the blind man's wife paint herself?

September hath xxx days<br><br>Briskcap, thou'st little judgement in Thy head <br>More than to dress thee, drink and go to Bed; <br>Yet thou shalt have the Wall and the Way lead, <br>Since Logick wills that simple Things precede. <br>Walking and meeting one not long ago, <br>I ask'd who 'twas, he said, he did not know, <br>I said, I know thee ; so said he, I you; <br>But he that knows himself I never knew. <br><br>Lovers, Travellers, and Poets, will give money to be heard. <br>He that speaks much, is much mistaken. <br>Creditors have better memories than debtors. <br>Forewarn'd, forearm'd, unless in the case of Cuckolds,<br>Who are often forearm’d before warn’d. <br><br>VIII Mon. October hath xxxi days.<br><br>Whymsical Will once fancy'd he was ill, <br>The Doctor call'd, who thus examin'd Will; <br>How is your Appetite? O, as to that <br>I eat right heartily, you see I'm fat; <br>How is your Sleep anights? 'Tis sound and good; <br>I eat, drink, sleep, as well as e'er I cou'd. <br>Well, says the Doctor, clapping on his Hat, <br>I'll give you something shall remove all that. <br>.<br>Three things are men most likely to be cheated in, a Horse, a Wig, and a Wife. <br>He that lives well is learned enough. <br>Poverty, poetry, and new Titles of Honour, make Men ridiculous. <br>He that scatters Thorns, let him not go barefoot. <br>There's none deceived but he that trusts. <br><br>XI Mon. November hath xxx days<br><br>When you are sick, what you like best is to be chosen for a Medicine in the <br>first Place; what Experience tells you is best, to be chosen in the second Place ; what Reason (i.e. Theory,) says is best, is to be chosen in the last Place. But if you can get Dr. Inclination, Dr. Experience, and Dr. Reason to hold a Consultation together, they will give you the best advice that can be given. <br><br>God heals and the Doctor takes the Fees. <br>If you desire many things, many things will seem but a few. <br>Mary's mouth costs her nothing, for she never opens it but at others expence. <br>Receive before you write, but write before you pay. <br>I saw few die of hunger, of eating — 100,000. <br><br>X Mon. December hath xxxi days.<br><br>Sol nearer the Earth in Winter than in Summer, 15046 miles, (his Lownes and short Appearance making Winter cold) Luna nearer in her Perigeon than Apogeon, 69512: Saturn nearer 49868 miles : Jupiter nearer 38613 miles : Mars nearer 80608 miles : Venus nearer 6209 miles : Mercury nearer 181427 miles. And yet Mercury is never distant from the Sol a whole Sign, nor Venus above two. You'll never find a Sextile Sol Mercury, nor a Quartile Sol Venus. <br><br>Maids of America, who gave you bad teeth?<br>Answ. Hot soupings and frozen Apples.<br>Marry your Daughter and eat fresh Fish betimes.<br>If God blesses a Man, his Bitch brings forth Pigs.<br>He that would live in peace and at ease,<br>Must not speak all he knews, nor judge all he sees. Adieu.<br><br>In my last year's Almanack, I mentioned that the visible Eclipses of this year 1736, portended some great and surprising events relating to these Northern colonies, of which I proposed this year to speak at large. But as those Events are not to happen immediately this Year, I chuse rather, upon second Thought, to defer farther Mention of them, till the Publication of my Almanack for that Year in which they are to happen. However, that the Reader may not be entirely disappointed, here follow, for his present Amusement, a few <br><br>ENIGMATICAL PROPHECIES,<br><br>Which they that do not understand, cannot well explain. <br> 1. Before the middle of this Year, a Wind at N. East will arise, during which the Water of the Sea and Rivers will be in such a manner raised, that great part of the Towns of Boston, Newport, New-York, Philadelphia, the low Lands of Maryland and Virginia, and the Town of Charleston in South Carolina will be under water. Happy will it be for the sugar and salt, standing in the Cellars of those Places, if there be tight Roofs and Cielings overhead ; otherwise without being a Conjurer, a man may easily foretel that such Commodities will receive Damage. <br> 2. About the middle of the Year, great Numbers of Vessels fully laden, will be taken out of the Ports aforesaid, by a Power with which we are not now at War, and whose Forces shall not be descried or seen, either coming or going. But in the End this may not be disadvantageous to those Places. <br> 3. However, not long after, a visible Army of 20,000 Musketers will land, some in Virginia & Maryland, and some in the lower Counties on both sides of Delaware, who will over-run the Country, and sorely annoy the Inhabitants : But the Air in this Climate will agree with them so ill towards Winter, that they will die in the beginning of cold Weather like rotten Sheep, and by Christmas the Inhabitants will get the better of them. <br><br>Note, — In my next Almanack these Enigmatical Prophecies will be explained.

Indeed, among the multitude of our astrological predictions, 'tis no wonder if some few fail; for, without any defect in the art itself, 'tis well known that a small error, a single wrong figure overseen in a calculation, may occasion great mistakes: But, however, we Almanack-makers may miss it in other things, I believe it will generally be allowed that we always hit the day of the month, and that I suppose is esteem'd one of the most useful things in an Almanack. <br><br>As to the weather, if I was to fall into the method my brother J--n sometimes uses, and tell you, Snow here, or in New-England, — Rain here, or in South Carolina, — Cold to the northward, — Warm to the southward, and the like, whatever errors I might commit, I should be something more secure of not being detected in them: But I consider it will be of no service to any body to know what weather it is 1000 miles off, and therefore I always set down positively what weather my reader will have, be he where he will at the time. "We modestly desire only the favourable allowance of a day or two before, and a day or two after the precise day against which the weather is set ; — and if it does not come to pass accordingly, let the fault be laid upon the printer, who, 'tis very like, may have transposed or misplac'd it, perhaps for the conveniency of putting in his holidays: and since, in spight of all I can say, people will give him great part of the credit of making my Almanacks, 'tis but reasonable he should take some share of the blame. <br><br>I must not here omit to thank the publick for the gracious and kind encouragement they have hitherto given me: — But if the generous purchaser of my labours could see how often his Fi'pence helps to fight up the comfortable fire, line the pot, fill the cup and make glad the heart of a poor man, and an honest good old woman, he would not think his money ill laid out, though the Almanack of his friend and servant, <br><br>R. SAUNDERS, <br>Were one half blank paper.<br><br>RATTLE-SNAKE HERB.<br><br>The Indians long made a secret of the herb they used in curing the bite of that venomous reptile a Rattlesnake; I hope it will be an acceptable service to these parts of the world, if I make it publick by the following description, with the figure of a leaf of it. <br><br>The top and branches of the plant, are thick set with small yellow flowers in August and September. It is a species of Golden-Rod, known from the other sorts by the smoothness <br>of the leaf, and its pungent taste, and occasioning when chewed and swallow'd, a small stoppage of the breath, and contraction in the throat ; and the stalk which is in some places less than a yard in height when at full growth, in others more, is of a dull purple colour, and smooth, and cover'd with a fine blue dust, like that on many of the English plums. It grows in most woodlands, but under the shade of trees is seldom rank or large, or with more than one, two, or three stalks. It is also found on the banks of dry ditches, and sometimes in them and in hedge-rows. But it is most luxuriant near to run-sides, if the soil be rich, and not too moist, nor too much shaded. The root continues over the winter, and if set in a good garden, will send forth (in the 2d or 3d year,) at least 50 stalks. <br><br> The Indians use it variously ; sometimes they bruise it between stones, and sometimes chew it and spit in the patient's mouth, some lay it to the wound, others about the wound, sometimes they boil it and give the water to drink, washing the wound with it likewise ; but always some of it is to be swallowed, either with the spittle or with water.<br><br>HINTS for those that would be Rich.<br><br>The use of money is all the advantage there is in having money. <br>For 6£ a year you may have use of 100£, if you are a man of known prudence <br>and honesty. <br>He that spends a groat a-day idly, spends idly above 6£ a year, which is the <br>price of using 100£. <br>He that wastes idly a groat's worth of his time per day, one day with another, <br>wastes the privilege of using 100£ each day. <br>He that idly loses 5s. worth of time, loses 5s., and might as prudently throw <br>5 s. into the river. <br>He that loses 5s. not only loses that sum, but all the other advantage that might be made by turning it in dealing, which, by the time a young man becomes old, amounts to a comfortable bag of money. <br>Again, He that sells upon credit, asks a price for what he sells equivalent to the principal and interest of his money for the time he is like to be kept out of it ; — therefore, <br>He that buys upon credit pays interest for what he buys, <br>And he that pays ready money, might let that money out to use; so that <br>He that possesses anything he has bought, pays interest for the use of it. <br>Consider then, when you are tempted to buy any unnecessary household stuff, or any superfluous thing, whether you will be willing to pay interest, and interest upon interest for it as long as you live, and more if it grows worse by using. <br>Yet, in buying goods, 'tis best to pay ready money, because, <br>He that sells upon credit, expects to lose 5 per cent, by bad debts ; therefore he charges on all he sells upon credit, an advance that shall make up that deficiency. <br>Those who pay for what they buy upon credit, pay their share of this advance. <br>He that pays ready money, escapes, or may escape, that charge. <br>A penny saved is two pence clear. A pin a-day is a groat a-year. Save <br>and have. Every little makes a mickle. <br><br>XI Mon. January hath xxxi days.<br><br>God offer'd to the Jews Salvation, <br>And 'twas refus'd by half the Nation: <br>Thus (tho' 'tis Life's great Preservation,) <br>Many oppose Inoculation. <br>We 're told by one of the black Robe, <br>The devil inoculated Job: <br>Suppose 'tis true, what he does tell ; <br>Pray, Neighbours, Did not Job do well? <br><br>The greatest monarch on the proudest throne, is oblig’d to sit upon his own arse.<br>The master-piece of Man, is to live to the purpose. <br>He that steals the old man's supper do's him no wrong. <br><br>XII Mon. February hath xxviii days.<br><br>The Thracian Iinfant, entering into Life, <br>Both Parents mourn for, both receive with Grief; <br>The Thracian Infant snatched by Death away, <br>Both Parents to the Grave with Joy convey. <br>This Greece and Rome you with Derision view, <br>This is meer Thracian Ignorance to you; <br>But if you weigh the Custom you despise, <br>This Thracian Ignorance may teach the wise. <br><br>A countryman between two lawyers, is like a fish between two cats. <br>He that can take rest is greater than he that can take cities. <br>The miser's cheese is wholesomest. <br><br>I Mon. March hath xxxi days.<br><br>Doris a Widow past her Prime, <br>Her Spouse long dead, her Wailing doubles; <br>Her real Griefs increase by Time; <br>What might abate, improves her Troubles. <br>Those Pangs her prudent Hopes supprest, <br>Impatient now she cannot smother, <br>How should the helpless Woman rest ? <br>One's gone; — nor can she get another. <br><br>Love and Lordship hate companions. <br>The nearest way to come at glory, is to do that for conscience which we do for glory. <br>There is much money given to be laught at, though the purchasers don't know it; <br>witness A's fine horse, and B's fine house. <br><br>II Mon. April hath xxx days.<br><br> A Nymph and a Swain to Apollo once prayed, <br>The Swain had been jilted, the Nymph been betray'd; <br>They came for to try if his oracle knew, <br>E'er a Nymph that was chast, or a Swain that was true. <br>Apollo stood mute, and had like t' have been pos'd, <br>At length he thus sagely the question disclos'd; <br>He alone may be true in whom none will confide, <br>And the nymph may be chaste that has never been tryd. <br><br>He that can compose himself, is wiser than he that composes books. <br>Poor Dick eats like a well man, and drinks like a sick. <br>After crosses and losses, men grow humbler and wiser. <br>Love, Cough, and a Smoke, can't well be hid. <br><br>III Mon. May hath xxxi days.<br><br>Rich Gripe does all his Thoughts and Cunning bend <br>T’encrease that Wealth he wants the Soul spend: <br>Poor Shifter does his whole Contrivance set, <br>To spend that Wealth he wants the Sense to get, <br>How happy would appear to each his Fate, <br>Had Gripe his humour, or he Gripe's Estate? <br>Kind Fate and Fortune, blend 'em if you can, <br>And of two Wretches make one happy Man. <br><br>Well done is better than well said. <br>Fine linnen, girls and gold so bright, <br>Chuse not to take by candle light. <br>He that can travel well afoot, keeps a good horse. <br>There are no ugly Loves, nor handsome Prisons. <br>No better relation than a prudent and faithful Friend. <br><br>IV Mon. June hath xxx days<br><br>Boy, bring a Bowl of China here, <br>Fill it with Water cool and clear; <br>Decanter with Jamaica right, <br>And Spoon of Silver, clean and bright, <br>Sugar twice-fin'd in pieces cut, <br>Knife, Sieve, and Glass in order put, <br>Bring forth the fragrant Fruit, and then <br>We'er happy till the Clock strikes Ten. <br><br>A traveller should have a hog's nose, deer's legs and an ass's back <br>At the working man’s house hunger looks in, but dares not enter. <br>A good Lawyer, a bad Neighbour.

!*V Mon. July hath xxxi days<br><br>Impudent Jack, who now lives by his Shifts, <br>Borrowing of Driblets, boldly begging Gifts, <br>For Twenty Shillings lent him t'other Day, <br>(By one who ne'er expected he would pay,) <br>On his Friend's Paper fain a Note wou'd write; <br>His Friend, as needless, did refuse it quite; <br>Paper was scarce, and 'twas too hard, it's true, <br>To part with Cash, and lose his Paper too. <br><br>Certainlie these things agree, The Priest, The Lawyer, & Death, all three <br>Death takes both the weak and the strong, <br>The Lawyer takes from both right and wrong, <br>And the priest from the living and dead has his fee. <br>The worst wheel of the cart makes the most noise. <br><br>VI Mon. August hath xxxi days<br><br>On his Death-bed poor Lubin lies; <br> His Spouse is in Despair; <br>With frequent Sobs, and mutual Cries <br> They both express their Care. <br>A diff’rent Cause, says Parson Sly, <br> The same Effect may give, <br>Poor Lubin fears that he shall die; <br> His Wife — that he may live. <br><br>Don't misinform your Doctor nor your Lawyer. <br>I never saw an oft-transplanted tree, <br>Nor yet an oft-removed family, <br>That throve so well as those that settled be. <br><br>VII Mon. September hath xxx days<br><br>To-morrow you'll reform, you always cry; <br>In what far Country does this Morrow lie, <br>That 'tis so mighty long ere it arrive? <br>Beyond the Indies does this Morrow live? <br>'Tis so far-fetched, this Morrow, that I fear <br>'Twill be both very old, and very dear. <br>Tomorrow I'll reform, the Fool does say; <br>To-day it self 's too late; — the Wise did yesterday. <br><br>Let the Letter stay for the Post, and not the Post for the Letter. <br>Three good meals a day is bad living. <br>'Tis better leave for an enemy at one's death, than beg of a friend in one's life. <br>To whom thy secret thou dost tell, <br>To him thy freedom thou dost sell. <br><br>VIII Mon. October hath xxxi days<br><br>On T. T. who destroy’d his Landlord's fine Wood.<br><br>Indulgent Nature to each kind bestows, <br>A secret Instinct to discern its Foes: <br>The Goose, a silly Bird, avoids the Fox; <br>Lambs fly from Wolves; and Sailors steer from rocks; <br>A Rogue the Gallows, as his fate, foresees, <br>And bears the like Antipathy to Trees. <br><br>If you'd have a Servant that you like, serve yourself. <br>He that pursues two Hares at once, does not catch one and lets t'other go. <br>If you want a neat wife, chuse her on a Saturday. <br>If you have time, dont wait for time. <br><br>IX Mon. November hath xxx days<br><br>You say you'll spend Five hundred Pound, <br> The World and Men to know, <br>And take a Tour all Europe round, <br> Improving as you go. <br>Dear Sam, in search of others Sense, <br> Discover not your own; <br>But wisely double the Expence, <br> That you may pass unknown. <br><br>Tell a miser he's rich, and a woman she's old, you'll get no money of one, nor kindness of t'other. <br>Don't go to the doctor with every distemper, nor to the lawyer with every quarrel, nor to the pot for every thirst. <br><br>X Mon. December hath xxxi days<br><br>Women are Books, and Men the Readers be, <br>Who sometimes in those Books Erratas see; <br>Yet oft the Reader's raptur’d with each Line, <br>Fair Print and Paper, fraught with Sense divine; <br>Tho' some, neglectful, seldom care to read, <br>And faithful Wives no more than Bibles heed. <br>Are Women Books? says Hodge, then would mine were <br>An Almanack, to change her every year. <br><br>The Creditors are a superstitious sect, great observers of set days and times. <br>The noblest question in the world is, What good may I do in it? <br>Nec sibi, sed toto, genitum se credere mundo. <br>Nothing so popular as GOODNESS. <br><br>In my last I published some Enigmatical Prophecies, which I did not expect <br>any one would take for serious Predictions. The Explanation I promised follows, <br>viz : <br> 1. The Water of the Sea and Rivers is raised in Vapours by the Sun, is form'd into Clouds in the Air, and thence descends in Rain. Now when there is Rain overhead (which frequently happens when the Wind is at N. E.) the Cities and Places on the Earth below, are certainly under Water. <br> 2. The Power with which we were not then at War, but which, it was said, would take many full laden Vessels out of our Ports before the End of the Year, is The WIND, whose Forces also are not descried either coming or going. <br> 3. The Army which it was said would land in Virginia, Maryland, and the lower Counties on Delaware, were not Musketeers with Guns on their Shoulders as some expected ; but their Namesakes, in Pronunciation, tho' truly spelt Moschitos, arm'd only with a sharp Sting. Every one knows they are Fish before they fly, being bred in the Water ; and therefore may properly be said to land before they become generally troublesome. <br><br>A WONDERFUL PROPHECY.<br>For January, 1737, which consists entirely of odd Figures.<br><br>E'er of this odd odd Year one Month has roll'd, <br>What Wonders, Reader, shall the World behold! <br>Four Kings with mighty Force shall Albion's Isle <br>Infest with Wars and Tumults for a-while; <br>Then some shall unexpected Treasures gain, <br>While some mourn o'er an empty Purse in vain: <br>And many a Christian's Heart shall ake for Fear, <br>When they the dreadful Sound of Trump shall hear. <br>Dead Bones shall then be tumbled up and down, <br>In every City and in every town.

!*PREFACE BY MISTRESS SAUNDERS<br><br>Dear Readers, <br><br>My good Man set out last Week for Potowmack, to visit an old Stargazer of his Acquaintance, and see about a little Place for us to settle and end our Days on. He left a Copy of his Almanack seal'd up, and bid me send it to the Press. I suspected something, and therefore, as soon as he was gone, I open'd it, to see if he had not been flinging some of his old Skitts at me. Just as I thought, so it was. And truly (for want of somewhat else to say, I suppose,) he had put into his Preface, that his Wife Bridget --- was this, and that, and t'other. --- What a peasecods! cannot I have a little Fault or two, but all the Country must see it in print! They have already been told, at one time that I am proud, another time that I am loud, and that I have got a new Petticoat, and abundance of that kind of stuff; and now forsooth! all the World must know, that Poor Dick's Wife has lately taken a fancy to drink a little tea now and then. A mighty matter truly, to make a Song of! ‘Tis true I had a little tea of a present from the Printer last Year; and what, must a-body throw it away ? In short, I thought the Preface was not worth a printing, and so I fairly scratch'd it all out, and I believe you'll like our Almanack never the worse for it. <br><br>Upon looking over the months, I see he has put in abundance of foul Weather this Year; and therefor I have scattered here and there, where I could find room, some fair, pleasant, sunshiny, &c, for the Good-Women to dry their Clothes in. If it does not come to pass according to my Desire, I have shown my Good-will, however; and I hope they 'll take it in good part. <br><br>I had a Design to make some other Corrections ; and particularly to change some of the Verses that I don't very well like; but I have just now unluckily broke my Spectacles ; which obliges me to give it you as it is, and conclude. <br><br>Your loving friend,<br>BRIDGET SAUNDERS. <br><br>UNDER THE HEAD OF ECLIPSES, APPEARS THE FOLLOWING :<br><br>You will excuse me dear readers, that I afford you no eclipses of the moon this year. The truth is, I do not find they do you any good. <br><br>When there is one you are apt in observing it to expose yourselves too much and too long to the night air, whereby great numbers of you catch cold. Which was the case last year, to my very great concern. However, if you will promise to take more care of yourselves, you shall have a fine one to stare at the year after next. <br><br>XI Mon. January hath xxxi days<br><br>Dick's Wife was sick, and pos'd the Doctor's Skill, <br>Who differ'd how to cure th' inveterate ill. <br>Purging the one prescribed. No, quoth another, <br>That will do neither Good nor Harm my Brother, <br>Bleeding's the only Way; t'was quick reply'd, <br>That's certain Death; --- but e'en let Dick decide. <br>"I’se no great skill," quo' Richard, "by the Rood, <br>But I think Bleeding's like to do most good" <br><br>There are three faithful friends — an old wife, an old dog, and ready money. <br>Great talkers should be cropt, for they have no need of ears. <br>If you’d have your shoes last, put no nails in 'em. <br>Who has deceiv'd thee so oft as thy self? <br><br>XII Mon. February hath xxviii days<br><br>In Christendom we all are Christians now, <br>And thus I answer, if you ask me how; <br>Where with Christ's Rule our Lives will not comply, <br>We bend it like a Rule of Lead, say I; <br>Making it thus comply with what we be, <br>And only thus our Lives with th' Rule agree. <br>But from our Fathers we've the Name (perchance), <br>So as our King is call’d the King of France. <br><br>Is there anything men take more pains about than to make themselves unhappy? <br>Nothing brings more pain than too much pleasure; nothing more bondage than <br>too much liberty, (or libertinism.) <br>Read much, but not too many books. <br><br>I Mon. March hath xxxi days<br><br> Jack's Wife was born in Wiltshire, brought up in Cumberland, led much of her Life in Bedfordshire, sent her Husband into Huntingtonshire in order to send him into Buckinghamshire. But he took Courage in Hartfordshire, and carry’d her into Staffordshire, or else he might have liv’d and dy’d in Shrewsbury. <br><br>He that would have a short Lent, let him borrow Money to be repaid at Easter <br>Write with the learned, pronounce with the vulgar. <br>Fly pleasures, and they'll follow you.<br>Squirrel like she covers her back with her tail.<br><br>II Mon. April hath xxx days<br><br>That all from Adam first begun, <br>Since none but Whiston doubts, <br>And that his Son, and his Son's Son <br>Were Plowmen, Clowns and Louts; <br>Here lies the only Difference now, <br>Some shot off late, some soon; <br>Your Sires i'th' Morning left the Plow, <br>And ours i'th' Afternoon. <br><br>Csesar did not merit the the triumphal Car, more than he that conquers himself. <br>Hast thou virtue? — acquire also the graces and beauties of virtue. <br>Buy what thou hast no need of, and e'er long thou shalt sell thy necessaries. <br>If thou hast wit and learning, add to it Wisdom and Modesty. <br><br>III Mon. May hath xxxi days.<br><br>A frugal Thought.<br><br> In an Acre of Land are 43,560 square feet. <br>In 100 Acres are 4,356,000 square feet; <br>Twenty Pounds will buy 100 Acres of the Proprietor. <br>In £20 are 4,800 pence ; by which divide the <br>Number of feet in 100 Acres; and you will find <br>That one penny will buy 907 square Feet ; or <br>A Lot of 30 Feet square. — Save your Pence. <br><br>You may be more happy than princes, if you will be more virtuous. <br>If you would not be forgotten, as soon as you are dead and rotten, either write things worth reading, or do things worth the writing. <br>Sell not virtue to purchase wealth, nor liberty to purchase power. <br><br>IV Mon. June hath xxx days<br><br>Epitaph on a talkative Old Maid.<br><br>Beneath this silent Stone is laid, <br>A noisy antiquated Maid, <br>Who, from her Cradle talk'd 'till Death, <br>And ne'er before was out of Breath. <br>Whither she's gone we cannot tell ; <br>For if she talks not, she's in Hell! <br>If she's in Heaven, she's there unblest <br>Because she hates a Place of rest. <br><br>Let thy vices die before thee. <br>Keep your eyes wide open before marriage, half shut afterwards. <br>The ancients tell us what is best: but we must learn of the moderns what is fittest.

!*V Mon. July hath xxxi days<br><br>One month a Lawyer, thou the next will be <br>A grave Physician, and the third a Priest: <br>Chuse quickly one Profession of the three, <br>Marry'd to her thou yet may'st court the rest. <br>Resolve at once; deliberate no more; <br>Leap in, and stand not shiv'ring on the Shore. <br>On any one amiss thou can'st not fall; <br>Thou'lt end in nothing, if thou grasps at all. <br><br>Since I cannot govern my own tongue tho' within my own teeth, how can I hope to govern the tongues of others? <br>Tis less discredit to abridge petty charges, than to stoop to petty Gettings. <br>Since thou art not sure of a minute, throw not away an hour. <br><br>VI Mon. August hath xxxi days<br><br>While faster than his costive Brain indites, <br>Philo's quick Hand in flowing Nonsense writes, <br>His Case appears to me like honest Teague's, <br>When he was run away with by his Legs. <br>Phaebus, give Philo o'er himself Command; <br>Quicken his Senses, or restrain his Hand; <br>Let him be kept from Paper, Pen and Ink; <br>So he may cease to write and learn to think. <br><br>If you do what you should not, you must hear what you would not. <br>Defer not thy well doing; be not like St. George, who is always a horseback, and never rides on. <br>Wish not so much to live long, as to live well.<br><br>VII Mon. September hath xxx days<br><br>These lines may be read backward or forward.<br><br>Joy, Mirth, Triumph, I do defie; <br>Destroy me Death, fain would I die: <br>Forlorn am I, Love is exil'd, <br>Scorn smiles thereat; Hope is beguil'd, <br>Men banish'd bliss, in Woe must dwell, <br>Then Joy, Mirth, Triumph, all farewell. <br><br>As we must account for every idle word, so we must for every idle silence. <br>I have never seen the Philosopher's Stone that turns lead into Gold, but I have known the pursuit of it turn a Man's Gold into Lead. <br>Never intreat a servant to dwell with thee. <br><br>VIII Mon. October hath xxxi days<br><br>A doubtful meaning:<br><br>The Female kind is counted ill: <br>And is indeed: The contrary; — <br>No Man can find: That hurt they will <br>But every where: Shew Charity: <br>To no Body; Malicious still; <br>In word or Deed: Believe you me. <br><br>Time is an herb that cures all Diseases. <br>Reading makes a full Man — Meditation a profound Man — discourse a clear man. <br>If any man flatters me, I'll flatter him again, tho’ he were my best friend. <br><br>IX Mon. November hath xxx days<br><br>A Monster in a Course of Vice grown old, <br>Leaves to his gaping Heir his ill-gain Gold; <br>The Preacher fee'd, strait are his Virtues shown  <br>And render'd lasting by the sculptur'd Stone. <br>If on the Stone or Sermon we rely, <br>Pity a Worth like his, should ever die!<br>If Credit to his real Life we give, <br>Pity a Wretch like him, should ever live. <br><br>Wish a miser long life, and you wish him no good. <br>None but the well-bred man knows how to confess a fault, or acknowledge himself in an error. <br>Drive thy business; let not that drive thee. <br>There is much difference between imitating a good man, and counterfeiting him. <br><br>X Mon. December hath xxxi days<br><br>The Wiseman says, it is a Wiseman's Part <br>To keep his Tongue close Prisoner in his Heart. <br>If he then be a Fool whose Thought denies <br>There is a God, how desp'rately unwise, <br>How much more Fool is he, whose Language shall <br>Proclaim in public, there's no God at all: <br>What then are they, nay Fools in what degree, <br>Whose Actions shall maintain't ? — Such Fools are we. <br><br>Wink at small faults — remember thou hast great ones. <br>Eat to please thyself, but dress to please others. <br>Search others for their virtues, thyself for thy vices. <br>Never spare the Parson's wine, nor Baker's Pudding. <br>Each year one vicious habit rooted out, <br>In time might make the worst man good throughout.

!*As I spent some weeks last winter in visiting my old acquaintance in the Jerseys, great complaints I heard for want of money, and that leave to make more paper bills could not be <br>obtained. Friends and countrymen, my advice on this head shall cost you nothing ; and if you will not be angry with me for giving it, I promise you not to be offended if you do not <br>take it, <br><br>You spend yearly at least two hundred thousand pounds, it is said, in European, East Indian, and West Indian commodities. Suppose one-half of this expense to be in things absolutely necessary, the other half may be called superfluities, or, at best, conveniences, which, however, you might live without for one little year and not suffer exceedingly. Now, to save this half, observe these few directions: <br><br> I. When you incline to have new clothes, look first well over the old ones, and see if you cannot shift with them another year, either by scouring, mending, or even patching if necessary. Remember, a patch on your coat and money in your pocket is better and <br>more creditable than a writ on your back and no money to take it off. <br><br> II. When you are inclined to buy chinaware, chintzes, India silks, or any other of their flimsy, slight manufactures, I would not be so bad with you as to insist on your absolutely resolving against it; all I advise is to put it off (as you do your repentance) till another year, and this, in some respects, may prevent an occasion of repentance. <br><br> III. If you are now a drinker of punch, wine, or tea twice a day, for the ensuing year drink them but once a day. If you now drink them but once a day, do it but every other day. If you do it now but once a week, reduce the practice to once a fortnight. And if you do not exceed in quantity as you lessen the times, half your expense in these articles will be saved. <br><br> IV. When you incline to drink rum, fill the glass half with water. <br><br>Thus at the year's end there will be a hundred thousand pounds more money in your country. <br><br>If paper money in ever so great a quantity could be made, no man could get any of it without giving something for it. But all he saves in this way will be his own for nothing, and his country actually so much richer. Then the merchants' old and doubtful debts may be honestly paid off, and trading becomes surer thereafter, if not so extensive.

!*To Abel Owens,<br>It has been a turn since we last tipped our tankards together and it will likely be a spell longer as I am in hiding off the coast of Massachusetts, I doubt this isle has even been graced with a name. The King’s men are breathing down my nape and quarters are too close for comfort. What you will find in this package is a scroll of the greatest value to me. Something that I hold dear above all the plunder and jewels that I have scattered about the globe, something that must remain secret and as such I must order you not to open it or read it. Carry it with you at all times and protect it, and what lies inside, with your life until I find you. It’s taking me longer than I anticipated to rid myself of those who stalk me but you know as well as I, it is only a matter of time before I shake them for good.<br>Be wary and wise,<br>Captain William Kidd

!*Joseph,<br>It has been months since we parted and things have not tacked to the easy course for me. I slew nine British sailors yesterday (or was it two days ago? No matter) and the bastards just keep sending more. But when I searched their corpses I found no commissions from the crown nor military orders, only coin and the red and golden crosses they bore around their necks. Is it possible they are not English sailors? It is of no consequence to you so on to the purpose of this letter; the scroll that came with it is everything to me. You cannot read it. You cannot open it. Keep it until I find you. If any man should ask you about it, kill him.<br>Captain William Kidd

!*To Hendrick van der Heul,<br>Hendrick, you are my most trusted advisor and closest friend and I pray this found you safely. You know what it is I had and you know the power it holds. They thirst for it- I know not who they are but I now know for certain they are not after me in the name of any crown. They are something else, something secret, something relentless, something with resources beyond measure. Something that frightens me like nothing else I have encountered in this life. I am holed up on a farm just outside Boston trying my most desperate and last ditch attempt rid myself of them for it cannot fall into their grasp. I have sent you the last piece of my precious scroll that leads me to where I stowed it. Hold it for me. They are upon me. If I come out the victor I will find you, if not- die with it. <br>Captain William Kidd

But as I searched the area the truth of their fates came clear. <br> <br>A fight broke out between them. Vicious, one of the men drawing a blade and stabbing the other. Then he set out for home.

!*BOONE: It stands upright, as a man, but its whole body is covered in a thick pelt. Its gait is slow and lurching- I've seen it with my own two eyes. It's clever, always at a distance or with something between us- like it knows where I'm gonna be before I get there. Things go missing where it goes, that much is certain. All manner of trinket. Took a man's prize buck antlers clear off his cabin wall. Takes kills outta traps too, wrenching 'em open with his big mitts. Somebody should find it and bring back its head for the world to see.<br><br>CONNOR: I found the beast Boone spoke of, covered in fur head to toe.

You won't find me out on the high seas searching for the beast, that's a guarantee I can give you, but it's a riddle that needs solving.<br><br>CONNOR: People across Boston spoke of seeing the monster. Reports varied in the details but most agreed that it was long and black and only appeared in the presence of an old man. Turns out the creature was the old man himself, diving in the water with a contraption that allowed him to breathe while submerged. The machine itself was as startling as any monster, but it poses no danger to ships.

!*BOONE: I'd been out in the puckerbrush for six weeks. Game was scarce in the area and my belly needed fillin' so a broke for the coast and some crab or lobster from the tide pools. That's when I saw it. A lighthouse said to have been abandoned years ago, but there it was fires a burnin'. Then the sound happened. A moaning in the wind. My heart crept up my throat so high I could taste it. Just then a ten point buck startled and I took after it. Got the buck but never went back to the lighthouse. Spirits in there I wager. I'd challenge any man to venture nearby.<br><br>CONNOR: I went to the lighthouse and it was abandoned. Among the debris left by its previous occupants, I found nothing more than a scarecrow. There are no spirits up there, none that must be feared at any rate.

Then it was gone. I wasn't alone. Those next to me had their heads cocked the same- craned as far back as it could go- mouths agape. Couldn't tell you what it was but I can tell you it wasn't of this earth.<br><br>CONNOR: This image sky is the talk of Boston. However, my investigation revealed that the source is most certainly of this earth. Nothing more than an umbrella reflecting moonlight among in the trees, coupled with imagination and gossip.

His whole battalion was routed and they lost the encounter. But the lad didn't die. He's been wandering the bush on horseback around the battlefield ever since, searching for his head, chasin' innocents when he sees 'em, taking their domes for his own. He wears a pumpkin for a head now, until he finds what he's looking for. Like I said, I haven't seen 'em, but I have seen the bodies he leaves lying about, headless and grotesque. God rest their souls.<br><br>CONNOR: I found the Headless Horseman. The stories of his taking human heads are no fables. But he was a man.

!*This is a musical instrument created by Benjamin Franklin. He came up with the idea after seeing someone 'play' water-filled wine glasses at a show in London. It seems there wasn’t much entertainment in those days, and even the entertainment wasn’t much entertainment.<br><br>The principle of the Armonica is the same - the instrument itself is a series of bowls stacked together. You use a treadle to turn them and 'play' them by running a wet finger along the turning edges of the bowls. <br><br>The Armonica debuted in London in 1762, and became quite popular for a time - particularly in Germany, where Mozart wrote two pieces for it. That’s a pretty sweet celebrity endorsement. However, its success was short-lived. It quickly fell out of favour, probably because there was no way to amplify it to be heard in large concert halls.<br><br>Of course, that sounds quite dull so I'd much rather believe the more dramatic alternate explanation - playing the armonica was banned because it could cause insanity. <br><br>I’d certainly go mental if someone forced me to sit in a hall and listen to it. Mind you, I’ve got a soft spot for the bagpipes, so maybe I’m halfway there.

!*Heating a home in the 18th Century posed some problems. You more or less needed a fire - kept in a fireplace - but fireplaces were inefficient, smoky, and had to be built against wall, meaning you were losing heat through the back wall of your house. Not to mention the quantities of wood required to heat a city caused rapid deforestation (yes, people wanted to save the trees even in the 1700s – that’s really worked out, hasn’t it?) <br><br>This was Benjamin Franklin's solution to the problem - modestly named the Franklin Stove.<br><br>The stove is essentially metal fireplace that could be placed in the middle of a room, rather than on the outside. According to Franklin's designs, it could use 1/4 of the wood of a traditional fireplace, but give off twice as much heat. It also had a much smaller chance of giving off a spark that would burn your whole house down, which you've got to admit is an advantage in any heating system.<br><br>Franklin was offered a patent on the stove, but he decided not to take it- he wanted people to use his invention free of charge. Which was very philanthropic of him, but others weren't so civic-minded - at least one London merchant patented a modified version of the stove and made a fortune off of it.<br><br>Proof that the world was full of arseholes, even before the internet.

!*An electrostatic generator is a device used for generating static electricity for use in scientific experiments. In fact, that’s actually why it was named an Electrostatic Generator. This particular machine is an earlier version of the ones you find in science museums - you know, the things they use to make children's' hair stand on end (which teaches them that science can be fun!)<br><br>Of course, since there wasn’t enough science to fill a science museum in the 18th century, electrostatic generators were of somewhat limited use - until the invention of the Leyden Jar, which could actually store the electricity they created.

Id: [0x00064C55]
!*We all love jars, don’t we? And this jar is an early device for storing electricity - generally, the electricity made by an electrostatic generator. Benjamin Franklin used them in his experiments - they're a form of rudimentary battery. They were first invented in the town of Leyden in 1745, in what's now the Netherlands, by a scientist named Pieter van Musschenbroek. It was probably called the Leyden Jar because who in God’s name was going to ask for a van Musschenbroek Jar? Sounds like something you’d ask for in a club of ill repute.<br><br>The jar's design is fairly simple – mainly because it’s a jar. This one is a glass bottle with metal foil layered on the outside and inside - but it represents a huge step forward in the understanding of electricity, because it gave scientists something to work with. Before this they could create electricity, but had nowhere to store it - not exactly practical.<br><br>I'd be careful around the jar if I were you. You could get a nasty shock.  <br><br>Come to think of it, have a play with it. Go on. Forget I said anything.

!*An orrery is a clockwork device that's meant to show the rotation of the earth, moon and sun - although it might include other planets, depending on its size. Extremely hard to pronounce for people who can’t say their ‘r’s, orreries became popular in the 18th century as a conversation piece. No English gentleman's library was complete without one.<br><br>The name 'orrery' comes from the man who commissioned the first one - Charles Boyle, earl of Orrery. Oddly, it's not named after the man who invented it - George Graham - or the man who built it - John Rowley. Another example of the rich taking credit for something because they had the money to buy it - not because they had the brains to think it up in the first place.<br><br>Also, try to say the name out loud five times fast. It's not easy. And you’ll look insane.

!*Franklin invented the busybody based on a similar design he'd seen in Europe. It's a set of three mirrors meant to be hung from a second floor window. The mirrors are angled so that when you look out you can see who's knocking at your front door - a difficult prospect in some Philadelphia neighbourhoods, where the buildings are high and narrow. Of course, with a little tweaking, the mirrors can be used to watch your neighbor's door as well - hence the name (though I’d have called them ‘Nosy Old Bats’ and marketed them very much at the over-70s market).<br><br>Busybodies are still used in Philadelphia today, probably because knowing who's at your front door is handy, and spying on your neighbours never really goes out of style.

!*This engine was invented by James Watt, who worked on it between 1763 and 1776. It's not the first steam engine ever to be created - the design is based on something called the Newcomen engine, which dates back to 1712. However, the Watt engine is widely considered the first design that was actually practical.<br><br>Watt's engine had two advantages over other engines of the day - it operated at a low pressure - meaning that there would be fewer boiler explosions when it was used (and boiler explosions could be so annoying) - and didn't waste coal - which, like gasoline today, was expensive. In fact, his design was so good, it wouldn't be significantly improved on for another hundred years.

!*Benjamin Franklin is probably most famous for flying a kite with a metal key attached to the bottom through some storm clouds. <br><br>Without the science bit, that actually makes him just sound a bit simple. <br><br>So here’s what he was doing: He was trying to see whether he could pick up an electrical charge - thus proving some of his theories about electricity (namely that lightning was electricity, which might seem obvious now but which hadn't been proven at the time). The experiment was successful - the kite picked up a charge that caused visible sparks when a person touched the key.<br><br>Of course, the popular myth is that Franklin flew the kite into the middle of a storm, and it was struck by lightning. That's obviously false, since it would have killed Franklin - or, if you believe popular comic books, turned him into some sort of superhero formed of pure electricity, which literally none of the history books seems to claim. <br><br>I’ll keep looking. It’s got to be in there somewhere.

!*The first drinkable glass of soda water was made by Joseph Priestley, a minister, philosopher and friend of Benjamin Franklin. In 1767, Priestley lived in Leeds, England, right next door to a brewery… which you might think sounds wonderfully convenient, but actually means that most things in your house end up smelling of yeast and malt – although, if you’ve ever been to Leeds, you’ll know your clothes smelling of yeast pretty much makes you posh. <br><br>Actually, in Leeds, clothes pretty much make you posh.<br><br>Priestley was given permission to perform scientific experiments above the vats in the brewery - a flagrant violation of modern health codes, but apparently not frowned upon at the time. He found that when he held a bowl of water above the brewery gases (which he called "fixed air"), they infused the water, making it bubbly.<br><br>Priestley excitedly shared his new beverage with his friends, but he didn't realize (or didn't care about) its money-making potential. The creation of soft drinks would have to wait for future (and more "financially motivated") innovators.

!*The Providence was one of many sailing ships in the British Merchant Navy - which basically means it was a trade ship, rather than one meant for war. You'll notice it's carrying cannon, but those are mainly for protection against pirate or privateer vessels (or for turning the ship into a privateer vessel, should the need arise.)<br><br>The ship was built in 1748, and made several trips a year between Britain and the North American colonies - with occasional visits to the West Indies. The manifest doesn't indicate anything particularly interesting - mostly it carried staples like tea, molasses and cloth. It's captained by its part-owner, one Samuel Smythe, who got something of a reputation among sailors for both cruelty to his crew and penny-pinching on rations.  <br><br>Incidentally - that's not exactly a way to keep good sailors on board. The crew is probably both inexperienced and disgruntled. Ideally, you want an experienced crew who are hugely gruntled. Although you likely don't know much about running an 18th century sailing vessel - odds are you won't notice the difference.

!*Don't let appearances deceive you - you're looking at the former flagship of the Assassin navy - if perhaps a little past its prime.<br><br>The Aquila was built in France in 1749, in the city of Brest. <br><br>Stop it.<br><br>The design was incredibly innovative for its time - the ship was light, fast, and could carry a surprising amount of artillery for its size.  It would be decades before there were schooners that could match the Aquila's speed. Of course, there were some disadvantages to the design - namely that the ship handling was very touchy and required an experienced crew. That meant the Aquila was under-utilized until the Assassins hired someone who would be able to use the ship to its full potential - Robert Faulkner. <br><br>In 1754, the Aquila followed a Templar ship into a storm and was lost with all hands aboard - or so we wanted the Templars to think. In reality, it sustained only minor damage, was refitted, and became the Assassins' secret weapon  - staying out of major harbours, using its speed and the element of surprise to harass ships on Templar business. The Aquila took on mythical qualities - it was whispered about in ports along the eastern seaboard as the "Ghost of the North Seas" - a pirate vessel crewed by ghosts that could appear and disappear into a sudden fog.  (This reputation was due both to Faulkner's uncommon skill, and the superstitious nature of most sailors, who loved a ghost story and all wanted to marry a mermaid.)<br><br>Eventually the Templars cottoned on to what had happened - but it did take them more than a decade. (They weren’t the sharpest tools, let’s say, in a box full of spoons.) In 1768, the ship was caught in a trap by 3 British frigates. The Aquila was able to limp away from the battle, but ran aground in shallow water. The British left it for lost. Robert Faulkner survived the battle, and had the ship towed back to a private bay near Boston, where it - and Faulkner - slowly deteriorated.<br><br>That is, until Connor found them both.

!*If a ship could sound sexy, it’s this one. La Belladona was one of the first French ships to carry aid to the Continental Army - starting before France officially joined the American Revolution, but (obviously) after they started secretly supplying the Patriots with weaponry. <br><br>The ship's original name wasn't Belladonna - it was repainted before it left France in order to keep its nature and destination a secret. The crew, however, was French, captained by Lieutenant Commander Auguste Le Moyne.  The ship's cargo was valuable enough that it warranted a personal escort from the USS Randolph. However according to LeMoyne's log, after two weeks at sea, the Randolph disappeared one morning - never to reappear. <br><br>Fortunately for them, Connor happened along.

Id: [0x00064C68]
!*The USS Randolph is one of the first ships built for the Continental Navy. Congress ordered its construction in December 1776. It's a 32-gun frigate, with a somewhat spotty history. And no, I don't just mean that fact that it was captained by a known Templar - Nicholas Biddle.<br><br>The ship was finished in July of 1776, but Biddle didn't come aboard as captain until October. Even then, the ship suffered from a lack of experienced crew - it was eventually staffed by British sailors who had been imprisoned in Philadelphia. The Randolph finally set sail in February of 1777, only to end up in Charlestown in March, with its masts broken and its crew decimated by fever. What a rubbish trip. What’s more, there'd also been a mutiny, which you should probably expect when you try to press British sailors into service of an enemy navy. It sort of goes against what they stand for.<br><br>Repairs to the ship took longer than expected, since the masts were hit by lightning twice while construction was underway. After that lightning rods were installed on the masts. (You'd think they might have thought of that earlier, but to be fair lightning rods were a relatively new-fangled invention at the time.)<br><br>The Randolph didn't really begin its military career in earnest until it left Charlestown in August, 1777 - more than a year and a half after Congress ordered it built.

!*You probably don't know much about 18th Century Naval Warfare (because you don't know much about anything at all), so here's a rundown of some of the types of vessels you're likely to encounter:<br><br>FRIGATES - these are long, relatively light vessels with a lot of guns - more than 28, if you want to get technical about it. Frigates were light and easily maneuverable, so they were often used for reconnaissance, or escorting merchant vessels. “Frigate” is also a terrific word to use if you want to swear but your mother-in-law is nearby.<br><br>GUNBOATS - These were smaller vessels, generally containing only one gun - but it was a really big gun. The gun in the boat is where the term “gunboat” gets the word “gun” from – it’s not known why the word “boat” is there. Gunboats were relatively inexpensive to build, and could be assembled quickly. They were most often used to bombard targets on land. Although gunboats can easily be destroyed by a larger ship - such as a frigate - several gunboats together could do some serious damage before a larger ship could destroy them all. Strength in numbers. And guns, of course. Mostly guns.<br><br>SCHOONER - Schooners are small, light craft, noted for their speed.  These were the preferred ships for privateers during the American Revolution - there was nothing better for breaking through enemy lines faster than you could get shot at - or for making a fast getaway. Nowadays, of course, we have jet skis.<br><br>MAN O' WAR - This isn't really a naval classification, but more of a catch-all term for a warship carrying a lot of cannon. Most of the Man o' Wars you'll see will likely be Ships of the Line, which are essentially big ships with multiple gun decks stacked on one another. Basically, naval warfare consisted of lining up your ships broadside against the enemy's ships in order to hit them with the most cannonballs possible. Of course, the enemy would be trying to do the same thing. Predictably, the biggest ships with the most guns usually won - leading to the building of more ships, with even bigger guns. It wasn’t sophisticated, but by God, it worked.

!*Mason Locke Weems (later known as Parson Weems) was a one-time parish rector who became a travelling bookseller, writer and editor. He's mostly famous for his biography of the life of George Washington, first published in 1800. He was briefly the rector of Mount Vernon parish, meaning he counted George Washington as one of his parishioners.<br><br>Weems was a colourful character, and a bit of a rogue - always with some story to tell, most of them completely untrue - or vastly exaggerated. It's from Weems' biography of Washington that we get the well-known story of Young George bravely confessing that he chopped down his father's prized cherry tree. Weems writes that the story is "too true to be doubted", but who knows whether the phrase “too true to be doubted” is too true to be doubted...<br><br>Weems also went on to write biographies of Benjamin Franklin, Francis Marion, and William Penn - again, prizing being entertaining over actual fact. They sold well, however - paving the way for tabloid newspapers everywhere.

!*Charles Lee was a British soldier who went on to be a major figure in the Revolutionary War.<br><br>Lee's father was a Colonel in the British army, and started his son off in a military career early. He was sent to a military academy in Switzerland during his formative years, and then in 1746, Lee became an ensign in his father's regiment.<br><br>Lee was sent to the colonies in 1755 to fight in the French and Indian war. He served under Edward Braddock and then later at Fort Ticonderoga, where he was injured in the fighting. Lee recovered, and later fought at Fort Niagara. I’d always thought there were a lot of Fort fights fought. He finished his time in the colonies with the British conquest of Montreal.<br><br>Lee returned to England in 1760, possibly because he was seeking career advancement. He was named a Major in 1761 and was sent to fight the Spanish in Portugal. Though his service record there was good, Lee didn't receive praise on his return home - in fact, he was retired from the army at half-pay. After that, Lee became a vocal critic of military higher-ups, and the British Prime Minister - and found that his military career had (inexplicably!) completely stalled.

He'll be appointed head of the medical wing of the Continental Army in 1775, but for God’s sake don’t tell him, it’ll go straight to his head. <br><br>Church goes on to become a vocal Patriot – which makes him sound like a member of a weird barbershop quartet. But he was a member of the Sons of Liberty, and his local Committee of Correspondence. He'll even speak at the third anniversary of the Boston Massacre.<br><br>He's also got a house in a very nice part of town - being a doctor must pay well.

!*Here's a name even you should recognise - George Washington, who will go on to be the leader of the army during the American Revolution, and the first President of the United States. <br><br>I was going to say you probably know everything I'm going to tell you but that would be a lie. What you know is that George Washington has a lot of things named after him, and anything else you learned in school you forgot because you thought you'd never use it in real life. (You should call your history teacher and tell her she was right all along.)<br><br>George Washington was the son of a planter from Virginia. He was raised with little education, but was ambitious, teaching himself mostly from books. <br><br>Washing started in business early, speculating on land starting at the age of 18. When he was 20, his older brother died, leaving him the heir of the family plantation at Mount Vernon - where he lived until his death, and where you can still visit his grave today.<br><br>Washington got his military start during the French and Indian War, leading an expedition to Fort Duquesne in 1754 - a destination he never reached, having surrendered at Fort Necessity. The next year, Washington headed to Fort Duquesne again, this time as a guide for Edward Braddock during the ill-fated Braddock Expedition. Washington went as a volunteer, hoping that working for Braddock would get him a track to military promotion. Though the battle was a rout, Washington earned credit for organizing the retreat, and later that year he was made a Colonel in charge of the Virginia militia.<br><br>Washington completely revamped the militia, with hopes that under his organization and training they would be accepted into the British military. They never were. Washington resigned his post in 1758. I won't say the snub led to his contempt for the British, but snubs rarely help. <br><br>By the late 1760s, Washington had become active in political life - taking on a role in the Virginia House of Burgesses. He went on to be a member of the Continental Congress, and when war broke out in 1775, he was Congress's choice to lead the army. At the time Washington said, "I do not think myself equal to the command I am honored with." Which I'm sure inspired complete confidence in everyone who heard it. Imagine if you were on an airplane and the captain opened with that.<br><br>It's possible Washington was being falsely modest, but the fact is this: he wasn't a military genius, and he knew it. (Though I'm sure it hurts your American pride to hear me say he wasn't perfect.) Washington had several narrow misses where the army could have easily been obliterated - at Manhattan, and again at Brandywine - among others.<br><br>Washington won an early victory he broke the siege of Boston, but he then made the disastrous move of fortifying New York - a city he couldn't defend without a navy he didn't have. Even you can work that one out. He spent the latter half of 1776 retreating across New York and New Jersey, losing battle after battle, until Christmas, when he pulled off a successful surprise attack the Hessian troops at Trenton. <br><br>(And while that battle makes for some famous paintings, and it did rally the flagging confidence of the public, it was a minor victory in the war.)

!*Better known as "Lafayette", and it’s not surprising - his full name was "Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette". His business cards must have been three feet long. Lafayette was a French aristocrat and soldier who decided to join the Revolutionary War, and became one of George Washington's most loyal supporters. (I'm sure his friends just called him MJ.)  <br><br>Lafayette came to the colonies in 1777, intent on joining the war effort. So intent, in fact, that he abandoned his post in the French army. When the French army found out his plans, the ship he intended to sail on was seized, and according to one story, Lafayette dressed in women's clothing to better stow away on another ship heading for the New World. We’ve all done it.<br><br>Lafayette had been promised a place in the army before he left France, but once he arrived Congress became worried that he was just a glory-seeker. To smooth things over, Lafayette offered to work for free - and the ever-thrifty Congress awarded him a commission as a Major General. That may seem a hefty rank for someone who wasn't quite 20 years old, but Lafayette was both rich and a French noble, and at the time Congress was hoping to secure more aid from the French government. It would have made me suspicious. There’s no such thing as a free French.<br><br>Lafayette was placed as an aide-de-camp to George Washington – probably because that’s a French word and it seemed to fit - and the two became good friends. Political connections aside, he was an excellent addition to the army. Lafayette was a natural leader - his first real fight was at the Battle of Brandywine, where he was wounded. Despite that, Lafayette organized and led an orderly retreat - which saved hundreds of lives. <br><br>In 1779, Lafayette returned to France, where he negotiated for more troops to be sent to fight in the Revolution - exactly what Congress had hoped for when they hired him. After Lafayette returned to the colonies, he was placed in charge of the French troops, and was responsible for chasing General Cornwallis into Yorktown. There were other people there too. It wasn’t just one man chasing another into a town. That would have looked undignified.<br><br>After the war, Lafayette returned to France, where he was a leader during the initial part of the French Revolution. Unfortunately for him, he advocated a constitutional monarchy and had to flee when that wasn't enough to satisfy the general populace. He returned to the United States in 1825 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the revolution - and was greeted by adoring crowds.<br><br>In 2002, Lafayette was declared an honourary citizen of the United States, one of seven people to ever receive the tribute. Arrogantly, Lafayette didn’t even bother turning up to the ceremony. <br><br>That’s the French for you.

!*James Barrett was a Colonel in the rebel militia for Concord, and the town's representative in the Boston legislature in the years leading up to the revolution.<br><br>Barrett didn't exactly want the position at the head of the militia. He was 65 when the war started. He had his pipe and slippers ready and probably just wanted to watch game shows. Unfortunately for him, experienced commanders were in short supply, and Barrett had fought in the French and Indian war – so, colonel it was.<br><br>When the British came to Lexington and Concord looking for rebel weapons caches, troops headed straight to Barrett’s farm, where they were told they’d find the majority of the supplies.  Of course, by the time they’d arrived most of the weapons had been removed and hidden elsewhere.  Barrett wasn’t there, either. He was some distance away, organizing the militia march on the North Bridge – and overseeing the eventual victory at Concord.

!*Nicholas Biddle was an ambitious young sailor who became one of the first captains of the Continental Navy.   <br><br>Biddle joined the Royal Navy in 1770 (I mean the British side), but when the American Revolution started he offered his services to the Continental Congress. So a traitor, then - though it’s funny how you lot don’t generally see it that way. Anyway, while he was only a midshipman for the British, Congress quickly gave him command of his own ship, the Franklin. In 1776 was offered an even better deal - command of a brand new ship, named the Randolph.<br><br>History's mute on the reasons behind Biddle's rise to prominence. However, I think I might be able to solve the mystery - we saw Church recruiting him when Connor stopped at Nantucket.  <br><br>Biddle eventually became a privateer for the Continental Congress, patrolling British shipping routes, harassing their ships and keeping the spoils from any he could capture. He had a reputation as an excellent captain –he divided the spoils evenly, and never used corporal punishment against his crew. What a softy. Pitiful, really. Though I think you can see why that would be a job perk.

!*Israel Putnam (more affectionately known as "Old Put") is something of a legendary figure in Revolutionary War history, and possibly its best-known soldier – a bit of a folk hero, if you will. <br><br>Putnam was born in Massachusetts, but later moved to Connecticut to take up farming.  He's credited with killing the last wolf in the colony – crawling into its den with a musket, a torch, and a rope tied around his feet so he could be pulled back out. He really didn’t like wolves. Oh, and I believe I mentioned he was a folk hero? That's only part of it.<br><br>He joined the colonial militia during the French and Indian war, where he earned a reputation for bravery and inspiring the soldiers around him. He was captured by a group of Kanien'kehá:ka in 1758, and rescued just before he was to be executed. In 1762 he was shipwrecked in Cuba while on a campaign there where – you'll love this – he learned about cigars. He became a habitual smoker, and is credited with introducing the cigar to the colonies.<br><br>After the war ended, Putnam returned to Connecticut, where he was a vocal opponent of the British tax policies that led to the revolution. He founded the Connecticut branch of the Sons of Liberty. When he heard about the battle of Lexington and Concord, he immediately signed up for the Continental Army and was named Brigadier General of the Connecticut forces. He commanded troops at Bunker Hill – and the near-success of the rebels there sealed his reputation.<br><br>Washington had high hopes for Putnam as a leader, and he was named Washington's second-in-command in New York just prior to the battle of Long Island. Unfortunately, Putnam was a good soldier but a poor tactician. The battle at Long Island was a rout. Putnam fared no better at his next post guarding forts on the Hudson River, where he was outmatched by General Henry Clinton. After that, Putnam requested to be assigned to recruitment and Washington agreed.<br><br>Still. At least he had cigars.

!*Benjamin Franklin was a renowned inventor, diplomat, and one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. Translation: he was a rock star of the age.<br><br>Benjamin Franklin was born in Boston in 1706, the 10th son of a soap-maker. Ten sons! I guess his parents couldn’t afford a television. And also, there was no television. <br><br>He began working for his brother in 1718, as an apprentice printer. However, their relationship was rocky, particularly after the elder Franklin found out that young Benjamin had been writing for the paper under a pseudonym - Silence Dogood - and writing an extremely popular column at that.  (Human nature being what it is, the fact that the column was popular was probably the bigger problem.)<br><br>Benjamin ran away in 1723, and headed for Philadelphia, where he continued his career in printing and writing, eventually buying the Pennsylvania Gazette. The business, I mean – not just a copy. That would have been one of his lesser achievements. He stayed in Philadelphia for most of his life - that is, when he wasn't making extended trips to Europe.<br><br>Franklin had a talent for persuasion, and that made him an ideal diplomat. In 1757 he went to London to represent Pennsylvania in an ongoing legal battle with the Penn family. It was the first of several extended political trips to Britain, and he would act as the state representative for Massachusetts, Georgia and New Jersey as well. In fact, Franklin was in Europe for most of the Revolution, though he was in the colonies to help with the writing of the Declaration of Independence.<br><br>Franklin was a vocal opponent of British impositions on the colonies (like the Stamp Act), and although he first fought for the rights of Colonists as British citizens he eventually became convinced (like many of the founding fathers) that independence was the only real solution. Unfortunately, Franklin's change of heart made him clash with his son, William - who served as the Royal Governor of New Jersey. William remained an active Loyalist - the father and son never spoke again.<br><br>When he wasn't founding a new nation (and destroying his family in the process) Franklin was a scientist, inventing things like bifocals and more efficient wood stoves when he wasn’t mapping the Gulf Stream and discovering how electricity worked. (What have YOU done today? Made yourself a microwave meal and sat about in your underwear. Oh well done, you.)<br><br>He was also quite the ladykiller - Jesus. This guy - carrying on several 'friendships' with women while he was in Europe. The records don't say what exactly they saw in him - certainly not his looks. Maybe women like a man who's intelligent. <br><br>(If that was true I wouldn't be here. I'd be in Portugal surrounded by them, and you’d be looking at a blank screen.)

!*William Johnson was a land speculator, and Britain's principal treaty negotiator with the Indigenous peoples in the northern part of the colonies - particularly the Iroquois.<br><br>Johnson was born in Ireland, but moved to the colonies in 1738 to look after his Uncle's property on the Mohawk River. However, it wasn't long before Johnson branched out into business for himself, acquiring property on the opposite side of the river and setting up a sawmill and trading post, which he named "Mount Johnson". Which to me always sounds like mating instructions from a caveman. In 1743 he moved to an even larger parcel of land which he named "Fort Johnson". (He may have been an excellent businessman, but it's possible he lacked an imagination.)<br><br>Johnson befriended the Indigenous peoples in the area, particularly the Kanien'kehá:ka - whose language he learned. His respect for their customs helped him rise to prominence as liaison between the Iroquois peoples and the British government. Johnson was named Superintendent of Indian Affairs in 1756. As a contact who knows the land and its people, he's probably the best you'll find.

!*In 1754, John Pitcairn was a young captain in the British Marine corps. He fought in the French and Indian war, but I can't find much about his postings. He's listed as being on the HMS Lancaster during the capture of Louisbourg - that's in Canada.  No record of him being on the 'American' side of the colonies but it seems he did some covert work as well - that would explain the lack of details. <br><br>Pitcairn was promoted to Major in 1771, and he gained a reputation for being well-liked by his subordinates - and praised by his enemies. That's a difficult trick to pull off. Maybe he had a lovely smile.

!*Thomas Hickey was an Irish-born member of the British Army. He arrived in Boston in 1752, but it wasn't long before he was assigned to William Johnson's personal guard, apparently at Johnson's request (possibly because their families were connected in Ireland, or maybe he found the name ‘Hickey’ funny, the record isn't clear.)<br><br> Hickey served under Johnson during the French and Indian war, but then he left the army after being written up several times for disorderly conduct. After 1760, Hickey disappears from the historical record for several years. I do, however, have several mentions in William Johnson's household accounts of payments made to "T.H.". It's possible Hickey was working for him as a spy. If so, he should really have developed some tougher codes to crack.

!*Alexander Hamilton was one of George Washington's trusted advisers during the American Revolution, and the first Secretary of the Treasury of the United States.<br><br>Hamilton was born in 1757 in the West Indies, and was orphaned at the age of 11. However, his cleverness showed early, and his employers pooled their money to send him to university. Either that, or they just wanted him out of the building. Hamilton moved to New York in 1773 and began attending King's College (later Columbia University). By 1774, he was writing pro-rebel articles – not really in the spirit of attending somewhere named after the King - and by 1775 he'd joined the volunteer militia. Again… probably not exactly what his sponsors had in mind when they sent him there.<br><br>Hamilton fought during the occupation of New York in 1776. He was a natural leader, and George Washington appointed him an aide-de-camp - a job he held for 5 years. However, Hamilton was eager to get back into battle and in 1781 he commanded troops during the decisive victory at Yorktown.  <br><br>Hamilton became a member of Congress for New York in 1788. He developed a particular fixation on the funding of the Federal Government, which at the time was… well, broke, as it wasn't allowed to demand any taxes from the member states. (While that may sound wonderful when you're looking at your federal tax bill, it meant the government couldn't do things like pay their army. Soldiers like getting paid.)<br><br> In 1787, Hamilton was named the first Secretary of the Treasury, where he fought for a strong federal government (in heated opposition with Thomas Jefferson, who promoted states rights). Hamilton was responsible for creating much of the foundation of the US Fiscal policy, the details of which are probably important, but so indescribably boring I can barely be bothered even to finish this sentence. <br><br>But I did. Because I care.

!*Benedict Arnold was a General in the American Revolution, and America's best-known traitor, though I’m not sure that’s what he would have had printed on his business cards. Arnold also happens to be a war hero on the American side, though many people don't know that. <br><br>Before Arnold turned traitor, he had a reputation both for bravery and for genuinely caring for the soldiers who served under him.  He was instrumental to the rebel capture of Fort Ticonderoga in May of 1775, and his leg was crippled during the Battle of Saratoga in 1777. So he certainly put the effort in.<br><br> Unfortunately, his career advancement was spotty - he had a habit of getting into arguments with his superior officers, which is usually not a good move if you want a promotion. While George Washington recommended him for various commands, other officers had no use for him. <br><br>When Arnold was given command of West Point in 1780, he promptly tried to turn it over to the British in exchange for £20,000 and a commission as a Brigadier General. That’s the spirit! The conspiracy was uncovered before Arnold could actually betray the fort - and he fled north.<br><br>Nobody knows for certain why Arnold betrayed the Americans. His frustrations in being passed over for promotion obviously had something to do with it. But there's also speculation that Arnold had significant debts - the money he'd been promised would be sure to settle that.<br><br>Unfortunately for him, he never received the promised cash - or at least, not all of it. Since the British didn't actually capture West Point, Arnold only received £6,000. And while he did become a Brigadier General as promised, nobody trusted him - once a traitor, always a traitor.

!*Samuel Adams was a Boston Lawyer, a signatory of the Declaration of Independence, and a prominent political figure during the lead up to the American Revolution. I think that’s put your little life into perspective, hasn’t it? <br>Adams was born in Massachusetts, the son of another Samuel Adams, who was a well-off merchant. Adams (the younger one) went to Harvard, graduating in 1740. He went into business for himself, but was a dismal failure and ended up taking a job in the family brewery. A lot of men turn to breweries when their businesses fail, but in rather a different way. And that was fortunate for his historical legacy, since his relationship to beer may be the only reason most Americans have even heard of him.<br><br>Adams was elected to the Massachusetts Legislature in 1765, which was the beginning of his political career. He was a staunch supporter of Colonists' Rights (mainly the ever popular arguments over whether British Parliament had a right to impose taxes), but wasn't pro-independence - at least not at first. (I think it’s fair to say he changed his mind later.)  <br><br>Adams is often portrayed as an angry radical - but that's a bit of a biased picture. Adams disliked vigilantism, for the most part (though he approved when a mob forced Boston's stamp collector to resign, so perhaps he only disliked SOME vigilantism).  In later years, when Adams was in Congress, he refused even to join a political party because he found the idea divisive (a sentiment which he shared with George Washington, incidentally).<br><br>However, Adams' reputation for being a rabble rouser is somewhat understandable. He was a representative for the town of Boston after the Boston Massacre, and succeeded in having the Regulars kicked out of town. He spoke at the Old South Meeting Hall just prior to the Boston Tea Party, and it's said he gave the signal for the dumping of the tea (though there's some debate over whether he was involved, which I’m happy about, as a gentleman does not waste tea). <br><br>Adams was infamous enough that he had to leave Boston for Lexington in 1775 - to avoid arrest by the British who considered him a troublemaker. When the siege of Boston began the Massachusetts Governor offered to pardon any rebels who would lay down their arms - EXCEPT Adams, and John Hancock. Overall, Adams certainly was a thorn in the side of the British - though what puzzles me is why some Americans think being an angry revolutionary was a bad thing. It got you where you are today, didn't it?<br>Actually, hang about, yes - maybe I see their point after all.

!*Thomas Jefferson was the principal writer of the Declaration of Independence, and went on to be the third president of the United States.<br><br>Jefferson was born in Virginia, the son of a wealthy plantation owner - which is the type of upbringing that gets you into all the right political circles. Now, normally the wealthy and powerful sided with the British during the Revolution, but Jefferson was college educated and widely-read, which may be why he became convinced that the Colonists had a point about the British screwing them over. <br><br>Jefferson wrote extensively about the British obligations to the Colonists - which he regarded as a kind of contract that the government was violating by imposing taxes. Incidentally I do mean he 'wrote' about it, because unlike some other revolutionary leaders, Jefferson wasn't a great speaker.  That didn't stop him from making his mark, of course - in 1775 he was sent to the Continental Congress as a representative for Virginia, where he wrote most of the Declaration of Independence. Sweet gig for a writer.<br><br>Interestingly, Jefferson tried to include a paragraph in the Declaration that blamed King George for slavery in the colonies. The paragraph was voted out - and more than a little ironic, since Jefferson owned a plantation, complete with more than a hundred slaves. Publicly, however, he was an abolitionist. Which was lovely for him – and I'm sure the people he owned were very proud.<br><br>Jefferson went on to hold a number of political offices - he was the governor of Virginia in 1780-82, and then became the American Minister to France in 1784. When he returned to the United States he joined George Washington's cabinet as the first Secretary of State, where he fought for stronger states and a weaker federal government, in opposition to Alexander Hamilton. He was elected President in 1800.<br><br>Don't tell him any of that, though. You'll totally ruin the surprise.

!*You'll have heard of Paul Revere's Midnight ride, of course – he was one of several riders sent to warn Lexington and Concord of a coming military raid on April 18th, 1775. Revere's role in the revolution was larger than that, however. He was a member of the Sons of Liberty and the Continental Congress, and a participant in the Boston Tea Party.<br><br>By trade, Revere was a silversmith, and one of the most skilled craftsmen in the colonies. He also did copper plate engraving– most notably, the image of the Boston Massacre that depicts British soldiers firing into the unarmed crowd at point-blank range. A very effective piece of propaganda. You get very little copper plate propaganda these days. It’s a dying art.<br><br>Revere was also a shrewd businessman and he went where the money was. When silverwork wasn't paying the bills, he made dental tools, and when gunpowder was scarce during the Revolutionary War, he built a gunpowder mill.  After the war ended Revere expanded his business into bell forging, eventually making the bell that hangs in King's Chapel, a Boston landmark.

!*Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben was a General in the Continental Army, and the person credited with transforming the US army from a disorganized militia to a fighting force capable of defeating the British. Just look at the name. That’s a name you’d trust going into battle.<br><br>Von Steuben got his start in the army as a teenager in the Prussian army, rising to the rank of Captain before being discharged. He was introduced to Ben Franklin in 1777 while Franklin was travelling in Europe. Franklin knew the Continental Army needed training and Von Steuben was an excellent candidate. Franklin wasted no time writing a glowing letter of introduction to George Washington. Before the year was out, Von Steuben was in Valley Forge - bringing with him his pet greyhound, which he wouldn't leave behind. (Making him a rival for Charles Lee, though Von Steuben was probably better-groomed. I have no idea why there's a connection between military geniuses and dogs.)<br><br>When Von Steuben arrived, he started by training one "model company" of soldiers who would in their turn train others, and effective way of spreading the training through the ranks. He also wrote a manual outlining his training method – in German, later translated.<br><br>In fact, Von Steuben spoke very little English, but could curse quite thoroughly in French and German, which he did frequently (you always learn the rude words first, don’t you?). Unfortunately for him, the effect of his cursing somewhat lost on the troops, so to make the point, Von Steuben would call over his translator and order him to curse at the soldiers instead. I'm not sure if the translator had one of the best jobs in the army - or one of the worst.<br><br>I’m going with best.

!*Edward 'Bulldog' Braddock was the Major General placed in charge of British troops at the beginning of the French and Indian War, probably because he had a nickname like ‘Bulldog’.<br><br>Braddock was serving as the acting Governor of Gibraltar when he received the command in North America. He was given control of two regiments of Regulars and assigned to win back Fort Duquesne from the French (known as the Braddock Expedition) - as part of a larger attack on the French colonies on the continent.<br><br>Braddock had been well-liked as the governor in Gibraltar, but things changed once he reached North America. He had been known for keeping strict order among his troops, but it seems he went beyond that into brutality. He gained a reputation for being quick-tempered and cruel. He also displayed a contempt for non-British soldiers that alienated the colonial militia he was trying to recruit. So a cruel, racist bulldog, then. They’re my least favourite type of bulldog.<br><br>Braddock took a bullet to the chest during a battle in 1755, rumour has it from one of his own soldiers.  Which is a job hazard when you're nasty to the people around you and they all have guns. Sounds like the bulldog may have been put down.

!*Daniel Boone was a hunter and trapper, who, through skill and luck, went on to become a near-mythic figure in stories about the American frontier. <br>Boone was born in Pennsylvania, but moved with his family to North Carolina in 1752. He travelled to the frontier frequently on hunting and trapping expeditions, across modern-day North Carolina, Florida, and into Kentucky - the list goes on, but I’ll stop it there, because it’s just a list of places, and that can be quite tedious.<br><br>Boone is sometimes credited with 'discovering' Kentucky - which is ridiculous as I’m fairly sure someone else must have seen it once - but he did have a major role in its colonization by Europeans.  In 1773, Boone headed for the interior of Kentucky with a group of settlers with the intention of starting a town. Now, the Kentucky interior had technically been ceded to the British after the treaty of Stanwix, but not all of the Indigenous residents agreed with the treaty - or the incursion onto their traditional lands. Boone's group hadn't gone far when the party was attacked. Boone's son was captured and tortured to death - and the Colonists left. <br><br>However, Boone went back in 1775 when he was hired by the Transylvania Company to blaze a trail to the interior, known as the "Wilderness Trail". Boone settled in the area, founding the town of Boonesborough – arrogant - which he later helped to save from attack by Shawnee warriors in the opening years of the revolution. <br><br>Boone was made famous in his later years not so much by his adventures (though he had many, which I'm sure he'll tell you about), but by books written about his life - some of which contained … let's just call them historical inaccuracies. The one where he wrestled a sixty-foot Man-fish springs to mind. In reality Boone wasn't one to embellish his experiences - which may be why people felt the need to do it for him.

!*Francois Joseph Paul de Grasse was an admiral in the French navy, and is probably best known for his victory in the Battle of the Chesapeake, where he prevented British troops from arriving to reinforce the army at Yorktown.<br><br>De Grasse was the youngest child of a French nobleman. He joined the military at the age of 11 when he became a page with the religious/military Order of Malta.  He joined the French Navy proper in 1740. By 1775 he was serving as a Captain, he helped secure Saint Domingue (now Haiti) for the French – which probably looked good on a resume at the time.  <br><br>De Grasse was promoted to Admiral in 1781 and despite failing health was given orders to sail for America to help Washington. His victory at Chesapeake was so significant that Washington wrote to him the day after Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown saying the honour of the victory belonged to De Grasse. <br><br>De Grasse died in 1788, just before the beginning of the French Revolution. Despite his role aiding rebels in America, De Grasse was considered nobility in France and his estate was ransacked by French revolutionaries. His family fled to the United States, where they were welcomed as the children of a hero.<br><br>I guess ‘hero’ and ‘oppressor’ all depend on your perspective. You say tomato, I say tom-ahto… you say potato, I say pot-ahto.<br><br>Actually, no one says potahto.

!*Harrison was a noted clock-maker, originally from Yorkshire. He's best-known for solving the problem of tracking longitude on extended ship voyages. If that sounds somewhat dull, please remember in the 18th century this was a life-or-death problem. Though that doesn’t change the fact that it involves phrases like ‘tracking longitude’, and I’m sorry, but that’s still dull.<br><br>It was tricky finding a satellite signal for sat nav in those days, so knowing the east-west position of your ship during an ocean crossing was vitally important- and extremely tricky.  You could navigate by the stars - but that only worked if the sky was clear and the water was calm. Alternately you could keep an accurate clock. Unfortunately, most clocks of the day couldn't keep time on a rocking ship - or withstand the damp conditions of a sea voyage. <br><br>In fact, the problem was so important that British parliament was offering £20,000 for a solution - a tidy sum. Harrison took up the challenge, and made 4 versions of his clock - the last was only 5 seconds off on a cross-ocean voyage to Jamaica. Even so. That made them 5 seconds late, and I hope they were fined.<br><br>Unfortunately when Harrison tried to claim the prize money, Parliament said his results were coincidence - maybe because they were hesitant to shell out the money, but possibly more because one of Harrison's competitors was serving as the Royal Astronomer, and didn't like being showed up. It took the intervention of the King himself before Harrison got his money. By then, he was 80 years old. Still. You can buy VERY fancy zimmers with twenty grand.

!*William Prescott was the Colonel in charge of the Continental Army troops sent to fortify Bunker Hill in 1775. He's often credited (and that’s a kind way of saying ‘blamed’) for the decision to fortify Breed's Hill instead - a military disaster.<br><br>Prescott had a reputation for being a passionate, brave fighter. He was one of the last to leave Bunker Hill when the rebels retreated – fighting British bayonets with his ceremonial sabre. He got several holes in his waistcoat from the adventure, which he loved to show his fellow soldiers, but which must really have annoyed his tailor.<br><br>Prescott is also somewhat famous for telling the troops "Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes' – a warning to conserve ammunition until the enemy were close enough that the shots would hit. The saying is also attributed to Israel Putnam, and it's memorable enough that both men likely used it - I'll let other historians get into fistfights over who said it first.<br><br>Prescott went on to fight in New York City in 1776, and then returned home to Massachusetts. He fought again in the Battle of Saratoga in 1777, but apart from that he retired from army life. I'd wager he showed off those bayonet holes until the day he died, though.

!*Benjamin Tallmadge was the head of Intelligence for the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. The British, of course, would have called that an oxymoron.<br><br>Tallmadge was originally from New York, but moved to Connecticut before the revolution broke out. He served as a Lieutenant, and then a Major in the militia, before being asked by George Washington to lead the intelligence department. Tallmadge used his contacts in New York to form the Culper Ring - a league of spies that observed and reported on the British actions in New York. It's possible his contacts also discovered Benedict Arnold's treachery, but that's disputed.<br><br>After the war, Tallmadge returned to Connecticut, where he became a merchant - and politician. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1801.

!*John Fraser (Also spelled Frazer, or Frazier) was a Scottish-born trader living in the area of Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War, and a participant in the Braddock Expedition. <br><br>Fraser left Scotland sometime after 1745, possibly because of political troubles (the Frasers had supported the Stuarts, who were on the losing end of a rebellion). He set up trade on the upper Allegheny river, but was quickly run out of his cabin by the French. He moved further down the river - near modern-day Pittsburgh, built a new cabin and continued to trade. <br><br>Fraser was one of the settlers building a fort on the site of Fort Duquesne, (near his own land) when the French took over - again. Fraser supplied Washington's attempt to reclaim the fort in 1754 (which was followed by the defeat at Fort Necessity), and served as the Chief Scout during the Braddock Expedition.<br><br>After Braddock failed, Fraser gave up on the area - depriving the French of a third opportunity to chase him off his land, so I suppose that’s a small victory. He moved to the Tuscarora valley, before finally settling at Fort Bedford.

!*John Hancock was a Whig leader in Boston prior to the Revolutionary War, and went on to be the President of the Second Continental Congress - which was responsible for creating the Declaration of Independence. All very impressive. But most impressive of all was that his name would live on to be slang for ‘signature’. Now that’s a legacy. One day I imagine “Shaun” will be used by children to describe a world-weary sneer. I can but dream.<br><br>Hancock was born in Massachusetts, the son of a Reverend, but his father died when he was young, and John was sent to live with his Uncle in Beacon Hill. Thomas Hancock ran a prosperous shipping business, which John inherited when his uncle died in 1764.<br><br>Hancock was a noted businessman, and probably made at least some of this money smuggling - which he was tried for in 1768, though he was never convicted. He joined the Patriot cause after the Stamp Acts were imposed in 1764. He went on to be one of the instigators of the Tea Party. In fact, after the revolution began, he was such a well-known rebel that when the Boston Governor offered clemency to anyone who would lay down their arms, Hancock was specifically left out of the deal.<br><br>Hancock's probably best known for signing the Declaration of Independence; his signature was the first on the document. Possibly because of that - and possibly because Hancock was known for being extravagant - his name is signed with a flourish, written larger than any of the others. So now in America, your signature is sometimes referred to as "your John Hancock".<br><br>I needn’t explain why to some people, that sounds a little bit dirty! <br><br>But I will: it sounds like a penis reference.

!*John Parker was the Captain of the Lexington militia, and therefore the man in charge on the day of the battles at Lexington and Concord.  <br><br>Parker was a farmer by trade, but since he'd been soldier in the French and Indian War, he was placed in command despite the fact that he was quite ill with tuberculosis at the time. Parker went on to join the Continental Army in the Siege of Boston, but was too ill to be involved in the battle of Bunker Hill. <br><br>Parker died in September, 1775. The statue of the Minuteman on Lexington green is said to be a representation of him - though since there are no known pictures of Parker, the resemblance is sketchy at best. It's the thought that counts.

!*Robert Newman was the sexton of Christ Church (known today as the Old North Church), and a personal friend of Paul Revere’s. It was Newman who hung the lanterns from church steeple to warn riders in Charlestown that the British were marching on Lexington and Concord. Two lanterns – indicating that the British were travelling by sea.<br> <br>(And because it's a pet peeve of mine - you may have heard that Newman put up the lanterns to warn Revere about the British approach - it's one of those historical details everyone seems to get wrong. Revere already knew about the raid, and in fact had been the one to pass the knowledge on the Newman. The lanterns were meant as a warning to lookouts in Charlestown - a backup in case Revere was caught before he managed to leave town. Please learn this so you can impress girls on first dates, as I do, though they often seem so overwhelmed by it they rarely call again. That’s the power of knowledge, and it’s dangerous.)<br><br>Newman had some difficulty with his clandestine plan, though. His family home was serving as a boarding house, and several British officers were staying there. Newman managed to elude them by saying he was tired, going to bed, and escaping out a side window, like something out of a cartoon. His friend, John Pulling, helped him get the lanterns to the top of the tower while a third man guarded the church door. <br><br>Newman was later questioned about his actions that night – possibly because a twenty-something announcing he's going to bed early is inherently suspicious – but he talked his way out of arrest, and fled Boston. <br><br>When Newman returned to the city, he went back to his old job as church sexton. There’s evidence he took money to show tourists around the church crypt – including displaying the body of John Pitcairn. Which might have something to do with Newman being replaced by a new sexton in 1788.

!*When Paul Revere and William Dawes left Lexington on their way to Concord, they were joined by Samuel Prescott - a young doctor from Concord. Prescott was a member of <br>the Sons of Liberty, a natural choice for an anti-British night-time ride.<br><br>Prescott was in Lexington that night to visit his fiancée – I assume that’s who we saw run off.  He was intending to return home late – a happy coincidence for Revere and Dawes. Prescott knew the area well, so when the three men were stopped by British troops, it was Prescott who managed to elude his pursuers and reach Concord to sound the alarm.<br><br>Here's the strange thing - after that night, well, Prescott sort of disappears. I have a record that he may have died as a British prisoner in Halifax in 1777, but it's far from clear-cut. I suppose he could have left Boston with the British on Evacuation Day, but how he was captured and when - I have no idea.<br><br>And those are four words I never thought I’d say.

!*William Dawes Jr. was a Boston revolutionary, and one of the riders sent out to warn Lexington and Concord that the British Regulars were on their way the night of April 18th, 1775. The other rider was, of course, Paul Revere. While Revere took the route across the water to Charlestown, Dawes took the longer road across Boston neck. He arrived in Lexington shortly after Revere did.<br><br>Dawes was a tanner by trade. These days he would make a fortune in New Jersey, the amount of tanning that goes on there. And while he wasn't as politically active as Revere, he did wear a homespun suit to his wedding. Now, I know that doesn't sound intensely radical, but at the time it was quite a statement. At the time the rebels were trying to enforce boycotts of British products - like cloth -and encouraging people to Buy American. By advertising his suit was locally made, Dawes was putting himself firmly on the Patriot side of the equation. He might as well have worn a bowler hat and a mask with the King’s face on. Though that would have been weird at a wedding.

!*Molineux doesn't usually make the list of well-known revolutionaries, mostly because he didn't live to see the outbreak of the revolution (he died in 1774). He was, however, one of the major Whig agitators in the years before the war started - right up there with Samuel Adams, and John Hancock. <br><br>Molineux was a British-born merchant and supporter of the Patriot cause. As far as revolutionaries go, that makes him a bit of an outlier - British-born Colonists tended to be Loyalists. He was Anglican as well - and those congregations were decidedly British leaning. <br><br>However, you couldn't doubt Molineux's devotion to the cause. He was known for being something of a hothead. So much so that he threatened people with death when the violated boycotts on British goods. Seems a bit extreme. He’d have a bloody FIELD day on forums.<br><br>On the night of the Boston Tea Party, Molineux disappeared from the crowd outside the Old South Meeting House - though almost every other well-known revolutionary leader was there, still talking to the crowd. Molineux was, of course, supervising the dumping of the tea. For this reason alone, I am prepared to call him the most evil man in history.

!*Surry was a servant in the household of Samuel Adams from about 1765 onward. She was given to Adams' second wife, Elizabeth Wells, as a wedding present (because nothing says you care like “Here! Have a human being!”). However Adams was morally opposed to slavery and insisted that she be freed before she came to live with them. She was, and worked for the Adams family for nearly 50 years. Which would be so much less fun than working for the Addams Family.<br><br>(Incidentally, while Adams wouldn't own slaves himself, it wasn't something he fought particularly hard for during his political career. He did support anti-slavery measures in Massachusetts, but never forced the issue if it was going to cause friction between the states - getting along with other politicians was just so much more important.)<br><br>(I’m obviously talking about Samuel Adams, here – not Gomez)

!*Shao Jun is an Assassin from China, and one of the last Assassins to meet with Ezio Auditore before his death.<br><br>Jun was born in royal captivity during the Ming Dynasty. She spent her teenage years life as one of the favoured concubines of the Chinese emperor Zhengde. While not an ideal lifestyle – though I wouldn’t mind it, it’s better than digging ditches - Zhengde's taste for travel meant that by the age of 15 Jun had seen more of the world than most people of the era - which I suppose you might consider a bright side, if you try not to realise that even some cats had seen more of the world than most people of the era. <br><br>In 1521, the Assassin Order used the confusion surrounding Zhengde's death to infiltrate the emperor's compound and free some of the concubines, Jun among them. She immediately became an Assassin - but never forgot the women she'd been forced to leave behind.  Years later, she returned to the Imperial Palace to free the remaining concubines, only to find that they had been killed by Zhengde's successor, Jiajing.<br><br>Jiajing's response to the second attack on the Imperial Palace was swift and brutal, and caught the Assassins unprepared. The Brotherhood in eastern China was decimated. Shao Jun and her mentor survived, but were forced to flee Asia entirely. They travelled to Italy to seek the advice of Ezio Auditore - but only Shao Jun would finish the journey, arriving in Florence in 1524, shortly before Ezio's death.

!*Reginald Birch was a London merchant, the son of another London merchant (who, conveniently enough, also had the last name Birch. It seems it was one of those hard-to-put-your-finger-on things that ran in the family). <br><br>Birch started in business for himself at an early age. By the time he was in his mid-20s, he already owned several merchant ships, mainly dealing with the tea trade to the American colonies. That's pretty good going, seeing as by the time most people are in their mid-20s they don’t even own a shirt. I have him as part owner of the Providence, among others. Later in life, Birch also owned several businesses in and around London. He was a member of White's, which was a posh Gentleman's club in London - and generally a well-known and respected man-about-town.<br><br>From what I can tell, Birch met Haytham Kenway while working for his father, Edward. They were introduced at White's while Haytham was still quite young.  Birch would eventually take over Haytham's education - tutoring him while on a tour of Europe in the 1730s. From what we've seen in the Animus, it seems their friendship continued into adulthood - with them working together as members of the Assassins.

!*Haytham Kenway is a Templar who came to the American colonies  in 1754. From what we've learned, Kenway was sent here by Grand Master Reginald Birch, with a dual mission: establish his own Templar group to rival the colonial Assassins – and search for clues about artifacts related to the First Civilization. And when a Grand Master tells you to do something, you do it. Even if it’s just a Chess Grand Master.<br><br>Kenway didn't find the artifacts he was looking for. He did, however, recruit a small, dedicated band of Templars. He also attempted to forge a relationship with the Kanien'kehá:ka in the frontier, and one woman in particular, Kaniehtí:io. The two were briefly lovers – and however brief it was, it was enough, because Kaniehtí:io, unbeknownst to Haytham, ended up raising their son, Connor.<br><br>I'm guessing it was Kenway who became Grand Master in the colonies, and therefore the man responsible for the 1763 attack on the Colonial Assassins. That attack wiped out most of the membership and almost all of our records from that era. It's never been clear exactly what happened in that attack, or how Kenway managed to make it such a complete surprise. <br><br>In any case, I don't think I like this guy. Sorry to use such strong words.

!*Kaniehtí:io was a member of the Kanien'kehá:ka nation, living on the frontier lands near Boston at the time of the French and Indian War. Assassin records indicate she was the daughter of the Iakoiá:ner, or Clan Mother, and from an early age was being groomed for leadership herself. <br><br>While many in her community chose to ignore the incursions by Colonists into the area, and growing tensions between the French and British, Kaniehtí:io was convinced that they presented a very real danger.  She began to argue to anyone who would listen that the village should take action, rather than staying silent - which was contrary to the will of the clan chiefs at the time. She refused to follow their orders to remain neutral, deciding to fight back in her own way and recruiting help where she could get it - including from Haytham Kenway.

!*Shaun Hastings is one of the few members of the Assassins who wasn’t raised to join the order. He was recruited as a teenager after his investigations into Abstergo industries made him a target for the Templars.  <br><br>Hastings has a gift for organization, and as such the Assassins would be lost without him. With his talent for making connections between historical events, he's widely regarded as the most intelligent person in the order – and by ‘widely regarded as the most intelligent person in the order’ I mean he IS the most intelligent person in the order.<br>  <br>You may think he’s an arrogant bastard, but that’s only because he’s smarter than you and like a less-than-able teenage girl you find yourself not yet secure enough to move past your inherent and powerful feelings of joyless jealousy and simply appreciate me for who I am.<br><br>Oh, good.

!*Altaïr was born into the Assassin Brotherhood, in the stronghold of Masyaf. His early life wasn't a happy one - his mother died during childbirth. Then, when he was a young boy, his father was killed during the first siege of Masyaf. Only shortly thereafter the Assassin he died to save committed suicide in front of the 11-year-old Altaïr.<br><br>With his parents gone, Altair looked to Al Mualim - the then-Mentor of the order - as a father figure. Al Mualim recognized Altaïr's potential, and took on his training personally. Altaïr reached rank of Master Assassin by the age of 25 - an unheard-of accomplishment. If there was an Assassin Book of Records, there’d probably be a picture of this fella on the front.<br><br>Altaïr was one of the best fighters in Assassin history - with an arrogance to match. After a disastrous mission in 1191 in which he broke the creed and very nearly let an Apple of Eden fall into Templar hands, Altaïr was sent back down to novice rank and forced to begin again.<br><br>As part of his rehabilitation, he was responsible for taking out the major players in the Templar order at the time, including the Grand Master Robert de Sable. Tragically, in the end he was also forced to kill Al Mualim, who turned out to be both a Templar, and corrupted by the influence of the Apple. After his mentor's death. Altaïr took control of the order, turning it into the secret - and world-spanning - organization it is today. <br><br>One of the things that made Altaïr such a deadly Assassin was something we now call "Eagle Vision", a kind of sixth sense inherited from the First Civilization. It allowed him to read his enemies and surroundings in a way that goes beyond what the human eye can see. Of course, you'll know more about that than me (I can't believe I just typed that) because it's in your blood, and that's part of why you're here. <br><br>Well, let's be honest. You knew you weren't here because of my enduring affection, or my warm and passionate cuddles.

!*Ezio Auditore da Firenze was a Master Assassin during the Italian Renaissance, as well as being an inheritor to the mysterious ability of "Eagle Vision", and one of your ancestors.<br><br>Ezio was something of a playboy in his teenage years, but his life changed in 1476 when his father and brothers were arrested and executed for treason. Ezio tried to save them - but the evidence clearing their names mysteriously disappeared in the hands of a family 'friend'. Instead they were hanged as Ezio looked on.<br><br>Ezio fled with his mother and sister to Monteriggioni, where he sought refuge with his uncle, Mario Auditore. While Ezio had originally intended to continue on and settle in Spain, Mario had other ideas. He was the leader of the Italian Assassin Brotherhood and spent the next several years training Ezio, and convincing him to help fight the Templars responsible for the deaths of his father and brothers.<br><br>Ezio spent the next decade assassinating his way through the Templar ranks, eventually cornering the Templar Grand Master, Rodrigo Borgia, in Venice in 1487. Borgia got away, but Ezio was able to recover an Apple of Eden, and was formally inducted into the Assassin Order. <br><br>After several setbacks over the next few years, Ezio travelled to Rome in 1499 to confront Rodrigo - who by then had become Pope Alexander VI.  After defeating Rodrigo (but sparing his life), Ezio opened a hidden vault under the Sistine Chapel. There he discovered a message left by the First Civilization, warning of a catastrophe that would threaten to wipe out humanity. (Yes, that would be the one we're facing right now.)<br><br>Over the next 20 or so years, Ezio worked at strengthening the Italian Assassin Brotherhood, and fighting the Templars (which is sort of what we do). One of his greatest accomplishments would be discovering a hidden library belonging to Altaïr, hidden under the former Assassin stronghold at Masyaf, and containing another message from the First Civilization. He retired from the brotherhood shortly thereafter - which is what we call 'ending on a high note'.<br><br>He was terrific at jumping, too.<br><br>Ezio died in Florence in 1524.

!*You may not think it to look at him how, but this man was once the Mentor of a powerful branch of the Assassins - the Colonial Brotherhood.  <br><br>Achilles' life before he was an Assassin isn't well documented – it seems that most of the records were destroyed when the Templars nearly wiped out the order in 1763. <br><br>From what I do have, Achilles was recruited in the mid-1730s and became a Mentor in 1746. He had a gift for both recruitment and organization, so before long was head of a crew of Assassins that spanned the colonies and much of the frontier. Achilles strengthened the ties between the order and the nations of the Iroquois confederacy, particularly the Kanien'kehá:ka, though as far as our records show, Connor is the first Native American to actually become an Assassin.

He first took young Louis to sea with him at the age of 10, sailing from London to Boston on a vessel named the Windward. <br><br>As he grew older, Mills kept working as a merchant marine, travelling the world and gaining a reputation as a reliable and level-headed sailor. He joined the crew of Providence in 1752, staying with the captain and crew through a variety of hardships - though by 1755 he was thinking of moving on.

!*The son of a Boston rope worker, Harold Ring got his start as a young man, fighting on the city's docks. How magical. By the age of 19 he was earning money boxing for a local club - though at the time boxing was still technically illegal, what with it essentially just being two men hitting each other about the face and neck. By the age of 25 he was considered one of the best boxers in the colonies - certainly the best in Boston, an unofficial title he would hold until he was in his late 30s.<br><br>In 1745, inspired the publication of Jack Broughton's first rules for Boxing as a sport – what a masterstroke to have rules; boxers really are great thinkers - Ring founded the Boston Brawlers - the first legal club of its kind in the area. He was dedicated to making the sport safer for fighters (as safe as it can be when your job is to beat the stuffing out of someone, at any rate.) The Brawlers were a great success, and the organization operated in and around the dockyards for decades before moving to a new location in Beacon Hill at the turn of the 19th century.

According to their reputation, these two aren't averse to a friendly fistfight over pretty much anything -so if you're talking to them, try not to mix up their names. David is the older brother, Richard the younger. Oh. And definitely don’t try and be funny with their surname.<br><br>The Clutterbucks were a Dutch family, who moved to London when David and Richard were young. Their father was a dockworker, and so the two brothers grew up near (and in) the dockyards, running errands to pass the time and earn extra cash. They showed an early aptitude - an affinity, if you will - for fighting.  The two brothers joined a crew with Robert Faulkner on board the Stalwart in 1750 and working with him until he disappeared in 1753. <br><br>Unlike many who go to sea in search of adventure and treasure, the Clutterbucks' motivation was somewhat different - guns. They grew up hearing the stories of the sea, but it wasn't until they overheard a gunner talking about the power of his cannon, that they decided a sailor's life was for them.<br><br>(The sailor was not, in fact, talking about an *actual* cannon, but the impressionable lads missed it. Do you see what I’m saying? I’m saying he was talking about another type of cannon. A different weapon altogether. I’m saying he was saying his “cannon” had “power”. I’m using speechmarks to make it obvious. He had a powerful “weapon”. He “wielded” an enormous “penis”. Still don’t get it? Oh well.)<br><br>The Clutterbucks spent years travelling on various merchant and privateer vessels - almost always hiring on as a pair. They eventually settled semi-permanently in Martha's Vineyard, taking it as a place to rest between contracts before they would get tired of all the quiet and hire on to another crew.<br><br>I’ll explain that joke again later.

!*Amanda Bailey was a well-known and well-liked innkeeper in Martha's Vineyard around the time of the American Revolution.<br><br>She was born in North Carolina in 1730, the oldest of a large family. Her mother died when she was 14, leaving young Amanda to work and help care for her younger brothers and sisters alone.<br><br>Amanda first crossed paths with Robert Faulkner when she was a teenager - he was working for the United Company of Merchants, she was a bar maid - clearly a recipe for romance. They exchanged letters  - I suppose it was the texting of its day - which stopped when Faulkner disappeared from Halifax to join the Assassins. Sad face.<br><br>Despite reports that Faulkner had fallen overboard and was dead, Amanda felt that he was still alive - somewhere - and after several years she went in search of him. (Possibly so she could give him hell for abandoning her - but I'm speculating.) She never found Faulkner, and eventually settled in Martha's Vineyard, taking a job working in a local inn - which she later purchased.<br><br>Amanda had a born talent for leadership and organization. She was responsible for setting up the first school in the area - not to mention advocating for improvements to the docks to bring in more business. Her inn was a hub for gossip during the Revolution, particularly if you wanted the latest in ship movements. It will probably come as no surprise to you that she was a spy for the Patriots - but that's only been publicly known since 1919 when a box of her personal correspondence was found, including some coded notes in Benjamin Tallmadge's handwriting.

!*Robert Faulkner is probably the most storied members of the Assassin's navy - though he was never formally named to a position above First Mate.<br><br>Robert Faulkner was the fourth generation of his family to be a seaman (I’m glad I didn’t say that out loud) - but the first in his family to be recruited to work for the Assassins. He started off in the Royal Navy, but finding his career stalled (partly due to his inability to purchase commissions), he left to work for the United Company of Merchants.<br><br>In 1753, Faulkner disappears from the historical record, presumed dead - but that's because he joined the Assassins, as first mate of the flagship, the Aquila. <br><br>Faulkner was much sought after as a mariner - recruiting him was quite a coup for the Brotherhood.  He had a reputation for having a disciplined crew and an almost uncanny knack for avoiding trouble - not to mention predicting the weather. Whether through years of experience, or some other more mysterious ability (because I totally believe in those) Faulkner would know when a storm (or calm) patch of sea was coming in, and could use it to his advantage. Imagine that! A natural weatherman who could accurately predict the weather! The world would never see his like again.<br><br>Faulkner served on board the Aquila until it was nearly destroyed in 1768, always deferring when asked to become the captain - he never gave his reasons why. However, his love for the ship was quite touching - he had it towed to its location near Boston, despite doubts that it would ever be seaworthy again. Faulkner could have gone back to the sea aboard another ship, but didn't - he stayed close to the ever-deteriorating Aquila and took to drinking, which is where Connor found him.

!*Do you know how many one-legged sailors in history have gone by the nickname of "Peg Leg"?  Here's a hint - it's more than one. This guy wasn't easy to find. But for you - I make an extra effort.<br><br>Peg Leg started out as George Chilton, originally of the Massachusetts Bay colony. He signed onto a merchant vessel as a young teen, working mainly as a deckhand. By the time he was in his early 20s, he'd travelled the world several times over - probably logging more miles than your average jetsetter does today. (Too bad there were no 'frequent sailor miles' - he could've earned some free trips or some leatherette luggage tags.)<br><br>In 1732, Chilton was sailing on board the "Rachel" when the ship ran into trouble. It was due to arrive in Boston in June, but after it had been missing for 2 months, Chilton was found drifting on a lifeboat miles from shore, suffering from dehydration, and watched over by a single seagull. The Rachel itself was never found. To this day, he tells people they’re just “on a break”.<br><br>Chilton claimed to have no knowledge of what happened to the ship or its crew - but he considered the seagull a personal friend and kept it with him from then onward, despite the hygiene issue it obviously presented, and the fact that walking around chatting with a seagull made him look completely insane.<br><br>For a time he had trouble signing on to crews - not only because of his pet, but because he was considered "bad luck", and possibly responsible for murdering an entire crew. For several years he took work as he could find it, until the whole affair blew over. The ship disappearing affair, I mean – I’m not saying he had an affair with that seagull.<br><br>By 1740, Chilton was travelling the world regularly, but his leg was smashed by a cannonball in a run-in with a privateer vessel in 1747. After that he walked with a crutch - and later a wooden leg, hence his nickname.<br><br>While his claims of having met William Kidd are obviously false (Kidd was hanged in 1701), he's definitely sailed with some of Kidd's former crew - most notably Hendrick van der Huel, who captained the Octavius when Peg Leg served on it in the late 1750s.

!*Silas Thatcher was the nephew of a well-to-do London merchant who purchased a commission for him in the British Regulars when he was quite young. He was sent to the colonies in 1750, poor man, where he was posted at the defenses along Boston Neck.<br>  <br>You won't be surprised to learn that Thatcher had a mean streak - few men wanted to serve under him, which might be what led to him being posted in Boston in the first place. (Living in the colonies was regarded as something akin to exile at the time. Actually, come to think of it, not much has changed.) Men who advanced under Thatcher's command were noted for their cruelty - like his personal assistant "Cutter" - which even you might have guessed is a nickname, meaning 'one who likes to cut things - preferably people'. Not what I look for in a PA, but there you go.<br><br>At the time, pay in the army was notoriously bad, and soldiers would often pick up odd jobs in their spare hours to make ends meet (this made them rather unpopular in Boston, where unemployment was rather high). However, Thatcher found something he enjoyed much more - demanding protection money from merchants in Boston. Not only that, but he dabbled in theft, fencing stolen goods, and the slave trade – a real Renaissance man - capturing the local Indigenous people and selling them off to the highest bidder.<br><br>Which is what he was doing when Haytham found him.

!*The Abenaki nation originated in what's now northern New England and the southern Canadian Maritimes. Although suggesting they're only one nation may be a bit of a misnomer, since "Abenaki" can refer to numerous groups from the same approximate geographic area and language family (Algonquin, since you asked). <br><br>Although the various Abenaki would join together during crisis events (like when they were under attack from other nations) for the most part they had no central authority. That's probably partly what caused the encroachment of British Colonists on their land. The British liked to have formal governments they could negotiate treaties with – it’s just so much more civilised and sometimes there are canapés - so from the Colonists' perspective, no central government meant that the Abenaki had no claim on the land. Of course, they could have found out otherwise, but that would have taken work, and been complicated, and - perhaps most importantly - the Abenaki might have said 'no'.<br><br>While the Abenaki tried to remain neutral during the French and Indian war, they were quite literally caught between the warring British and French colonies, so some conflict was inevitable. For the most part, they sided with the French, who were less responsible for driving them out of their homeland. The lesser of two evils, I suppose you could say – though that’s a sentence I never thought I’d say about the French.

!*Also called the Lenni-Lenape, or the Delaware. Before European colonization, the Lenape lived mostly along the banks of the Delaware river in what's modern-day New Jersey and Pennsylvania.<br><br>The Lenape were one of the first nations to come into contact with Europeans - most significantly with William Penn, who founded Pennsylvania, which was a stroke of luck, given his name. While the Lenape relationship with Penn was mostly peaceful, when Penn died, his sons forced most of the Lenape off their land in a deal known as the "Walking Purchase".<br><br>During the French and Indian War, the Lenape sided primarily with the French, though some individual groups would later leave to join the British. In 1778, they were the first to sign a land treaty with the Continental Congress - agreeing to provide scouts to the army in exchange for supplies. I imagine they simply liked fine cheeses and onions. The newly-formed United States showed its gratitude by eventually moving the Lenape into isolated communities in Ohio and southern Canada. How wonderfully thoughtful.

!*At the time of the French and Indian war, the people of the Shawnee nation were mostly living in and around the Ohio valley - the territory surrounding Fort Duquesne. Traditionally, their hunting grounds had extended into Pennsylvania and Virginia, but they were being slowly moved from their lands by the advancing line of British colonization. Hoping to stop - or at least slow - settlement, some of the Shawnee entered the war, siding with their traditional trading partners - that is, the French.<br><br>By 1758, some Shawnee negotiated peace with the British in the Treaty of Easton. However, the treaty wasn't respected (and if you know anything about colonial history, you're probably sadly unsurprised by that), leading to another war - Pontiac's Rebellion in 1763. By the time the American Revolution started, many of the Shawnee opted to remain neutral, although some sided with the British - again hoping for help pushing back Colonists. <br><br>Unfortunately, the result was the same as many other Indigenous peoples - the Shawnee were forced to leave their lands, with the majority eventually settling in Oklahoma.<br> <br>Good lord. Settling in Oklahoma. As if their story couldn’t get any worse.

!*This was the army that George Washington led in the American Revolution, made up of various regiments supplied by the states. The army was officially established by the Continental Congress in June of 1775, shortly after the Siege of Boston began. In fact, it was formed specifically to deal with the Siege of Boston, which at the time was being carried out by the various militia who had fought at the Battles of Lexington and Concord. <br><br>The Continental Army was disbanded in 1783 after the Revolution was formally ended - possibly because people agreed the civilian militias were all the colonies needed to defend themselves - but possibly also because Congress couldn't afford to pay them. My money’s on that last one.

!*"Sons of Liberty" was the name given to a number of protest groups that formed to protest the Stamp Act - and stayed together afterward, organizing Anti-British rallies and enforcing boycotts in the lead up to the revolution. It was like a friendly club for angry men.<br><br>Although the groups would later become more coordinated, they started separately. 'Sons of Liberty' was the usual choice for a name because it was a popular phrase meaning "Colonist" at the time. As you might predict given the name, the Sons were mostly middle-class and, yes, male - merchants, lawyers, and politicians. Paul Revere was likely a member of the Boston group, to give you an example.  <br><br>The Sons (in all of the colonies) weren't above using violence and intimidation to get their way – who was? They threatened all of the Stamp Distributors into resigning - with the Boston group going so far as to destroy the local distributor's offices, and parade him through town before he quit in a very public - and likely terrified - resignation speech. <br><br>Given that, it probably won't surprise you to learn they earned a reputation for being the radical wing of the Patriots - rallying the people and sometimes losing control of them. A public protest in Boston turned into an angry mob that burned the governor's mansion, some groups of the Sons were also known to tar and feather British officials and sometimes Loyalists.<br><br>You know, standard good guy stuff. What a really terrific way to blow off steam.

!*Since the American Revolution happened in the dark days before there was an Internet - and even before telephones - organizing colonial opposition to the British was a little tricky. I don’t want to make you cry, but these clowns didn’t even have dial-up. The solution was to send out riders bearing letters to inform Colonists in other areas what was going on - these became known as committees of correspondence. (Correspondence being a fancy name for letters – if you did not know this I am amazed you have even read this far. Actually, I’m amazed you even can read this far.)<br><br>Samuel Adams created one of the first Committees of Correspondence in Boston in 1772 - in particular, he wanted to keep people outside of Boston informed about town meetings, so the governor couldn't invite only his friends to meetings. That would be less a meeting, more a dinner party.<br><br>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Adams' committee worked so well that everyone started doing it. Eventually all of the colonies had their own committees, focussed on presenting a united front against British-imposed taxes, and supporting boycotts of British goods.  <br><br>Really, Adams should have patented the idea. He could have made a fortune.

!*You might think of the Continental Congress as a gathering of boring politicians - which it was - but they were also responsible for organizing the Revolution and making decisions about the United States government, which also makes them rather dull.<br><br>Sorry – important. <br><br>I should actually say the "Continental Congresses", because there was more than one. The First Continental Congress was convened in 1774 in Philadelphia to oppose the closing of Boston harbor following the Boston Tea Party (part of the Coercive Acts). <br><br>All of the politicians had such a lovely time at their first meeting that they agreed to have another party just exactly like it - and why not? Everyone loves a party - right after the battles at Lexington and Concord. Being men of great imagination, they called this the Second Continental Congress. This was the Congress responsible for writing the Declaration of Independence, and forming the Continental Army with George Washington as its commander, so despite their lack of flair for titles they clearly had some thinkers among them.<br><br>The third Continental Congress was convened in 1781. It's sometimes known as the "Congress of Confederation" - and despite how mind-achingly tedious that sounds, they were responsible for forming a government for the brand-new United States. Since getting everyone to agree on how that government should work took some time, the Confederation Congress met over the course of 8 years ending in 1789, when the Constitution passed and they were replaced by the United States government.<br><br>Now, I’ve been in some long meetings, but 8 years takes the biscuit. I pity whoever was recording the minutes.

!*British Regulars were the foot soldiers of the British Army. You'll also hear them referred to derisively as "Redcoats" because of the red coats they wear as part of their uniforms (I'll bet you didn't see that coming) or “Lobsterbacks” because of their huge, deadly pincers. Or still because of the red coat thing, I can’t remember which.<br><br>Regulars in the colonies were notoriously underpaid, and many looked for work outside of their army duties to make ends meet. Of course, their room and board was paid by the government, meaning they could charge lower-than-average rates for their work. Since unemployment was high in Boston before the Revolution, you can imagine this made the Redcoats rather unpopular among people they were taking work from. That, and their huge, deadly pincers.

Id: [0x00064D19]
!*Grenadiers were originally the soldiers in charge of throwing grenades (hence the name). They were chosen for being tall, muscular, and fearless - not only did they need the strength to throw grenades far enough to actually injure the enemy - they had to be brave (or stupid) enough to stay in the front lines of battle to do it.<br><br>Grenadiers were also called upon to be fast, effective assault troops - helping with things like storming breaches during sieges. (You know, all the standard easy jobs that are likely to get you killed.)<br><br>By the mid-18th century grenades had fallen out of favour, but grenadiers were still regarded as elite regiments, called on to guard the right flank of their battalions - and still to do all the other dangerous work they'd gotten a reputation for.<br><br>An interesting note on the hats - they were made high and narrow so that as not to get in the way while you were throwing grenades (which is a good feature to have). Eventually, the miter hat became part of the standard dress uniform in numerous armies.  <br><br>It's also possible grenadiers just really dig the idea of looking like the Pope. History's mute on that point.

!*Hessians were German soldiers who were hired by the British to fight in the Revolutionary War. While 'Hessians' technically referred to soldiers who were from the state of Hessen-Kassel, it came to be a blanket term for all of the German mercenaries who fought in the Revolution.  The imprecision is easy to understand, of course. When a troop of German soldiers lines up and starts firing at you in a war, only the most misguided of geography nerds would stop to ask where they're from. So. Me, then.<br><br>Among the Hessian troops who were sent to fight in the American Revolution were at least 2 units referred to as "Jägers."  These were light infantry troops, known for being accurate marksmen. Accurate marksmen are very much the best sort of marksmen. The word 'Jäger' also happens to be German for 'hunter', and early members of the Jäger troops were mainly comprised of experienced foresters. <br><br>Again - 'really accurate gunmen who are good at fighting in the woods' is exactly the kind of soldier you'd want for a war in the American frontier. Unsurprisingly, this made Jägers the most feared (and respected) divisions of the Hessians.

!*Loyalists were Colonists who sided with the British during the revolution. They were also known as “Tories”, “Royalists” and “King’s Men” and probably also by their enemies as "those bloody arse-kissing ninnyhammers" (among other things). <br><br>While being a Loyalist might seem to you like 'the bad guys' that’s only because you know the Patriots won. It’s very easy to use history to look smart – even if you were subjected to the American education system (and ‘system’ is a strong word).<br><br>In fact, by some estimates as many as one in five Colonists were actively Loyalist – and many more tried not to pick a side altogether.<br><br>I expect the version of the story you’ve heard goes something like this: "The Loyalists were traitors who betrayed their fellow Americans to the British." That's a nice little fiction, since from a Loyalist perspective the opposite was true: the colonies were founded and owned by Britain, the Colonists were therefore British citizens, thus the rebels trying to disobey the king were the real traitors here. <br><br>Aha! You see? You’re a country of traitors! Try spinning THAT!<br><br>You’d also have to be pretty brave to be a Loyalist, particularly if the people in your community were Patriots.  Known Loyalists were frequently dragged from their homes, beaten, burned with candles, or tarred and feathered.  <br><br>That’s just in case you suffered from the delusion that the Patriots always took the moral high ground.

Id: [0x00064D1C]
!*Patriots were Colonists who united against the British Government in the Revolutionary War. Although, at the time of the Revolution ‘Patriot’ was something of a negative term. What we call Patriots today were more likely to be called “Whigs” – or, if you were a Loyalist, “rebels”.<br><br>The Patriot motto was ‘No Taxation without Representation” – a great phrase for rabble-rousing, though a poor choice of catchphrase for, say, a gameshow host.<br><br>It’s also a phrase that requires a bit of unpacking for a modern audience (By which I mean you, Desmond) The colonies didn’t elect representatives to the British legislature, and because of the travel distance between Britain and America, and the distinct lack of aeroplanes, it wouldn’t have been practical. Instead Patriots wanted to be governed by representatives within the colonies. Of course, they did have legislatures already - but those were rather prone to being shut down by British-appointed Governors whenever they didn't behave properly (read: do exactly what the governor wanted). <br><br>It’s hard to know how many people in the colonies were Patriots, the best guess is between 40 and 45% of the population. The rest were either declared Loyalists, or people who decided to remain tactically neutral (probably a wise choice, given that both sides were known for seizing the property of their enemies).

!*This club was founded in 1770 by several trappers who earned their living in the area, including Simon Girty. The idea was to have cabins that would be a safe haven and warm place to rest for Colonists who spent the season trapping in this part of the frontier. According to their records, as many as two dozen hunters used the buildings at any one time.<br><br>Although it originally started out as just a shared cabin space, it quickly evolved into a more formalized society. Human nature being what it is, hunters would brag about their kills around the fire - and exaggerate. After the several brawls over who could claim the title of the mightiest hunter, society members agreed to start logging their kills in writing - though why they thought this would prevent people from lying is beyond me.  It didn't. Sad, really.<br><br>By the way, yesterday I caught a velociraptor.

!*I can’t say I’ve ever understood it myself, but grown men beating each other up has a long and storied history, going back at least to ancient Sumeria. <br><br>Modern-day boxing began its rise to popularity in the late 17th century.  The Boston Brawlers got their start in the dockyards around the middle of the 18th century, but in 1804 they moved into a gym of their own on the north side of Beacon Hill. There they benefitted from the wagering dollars of the wealthy socialites living on the hill’s south side, who enjoyed nothing more than watching poor people hitting each other in the face for their pleasure. <br><br>I expect if you impress them enough with your manly prowess they’ll give you something in return. Perhaps a toaster. Or a black eye.

!*Stephane Chapheau is a Boston militiaman, and served as a cook in the years leading up to the revolution.<br><br>Chapheau was born in what's now Canada - near modern-day Montreal. His father was a cook for the French army who was killed in the fighting at the Plains of Abraham. After his death, Chapheau took on work as a chef in Montreal, but moved to Boston in 1764. While his personal letters indicate he was looking for a less complicated life, he was just in time for the unrest that preceded the Revolution. Fortunately for Chapheau, he didn't actually want a quiet life - and as it happened, the tensions in pre-Revolution Boston suited him exactly. Which is weird, because who enjoys tensions? Apart from a scientist studying surface tension as an effect of intermolecular attraction!!!<br><br>Give me a minute to stop laughing.<br><br>Chapheau was a man in search of a cause, and he found it in the Patriots. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the Sons of Liberty - participating in their 1765 protests surrounding the Stamp Act. He was present when the crowds ransacked Governor Hutchinson's house in 1765 - probably egging on the mob. He was also one of the crowd that witnessed (and partially caused) the Boston Massacre. <br><br>Chapheau didn't limit himself to protests. I have several fines for him on the books in the 1760s and 70s for public drunkenness, and brawling - it seems he couldn't keep out of a fight when the opportunity arose - and in pre-revolution Boston, there was always an opportunity. It was a wonderful time to be an angry drunk – the world was your oyster.

!*Duncan Little was originally from Ireland, the youngest son of a large family, which is confusing, seeing as they were the Little family. He entered the priesthood at a young age, and was sent to Africa as a missionary in 1756.<br><br>Little spent several years in Africa, but in 1760 he returned to Ireland, leaving the priesthood entirely - I'd tell you why, but it seems that information is locked behind a wall at the Vatican and I'm not hacking into their records today as they seem to have changed their password from W3L0V3P0P3 again. The next information I have about him is as a passenger on a ship to Boston in 1763. From his letters, it seems his family more or less drove him away over his split with the Catholic Church. (Blood being thicker than water and all of that.) <br><br>Little settled in Boston's North End, where he gained a reputation as a good mediator - fair and less expensive than going before the local judiciary. When he wasn't spending time at the local pub, he was helping people to solve their problems - generally by talking them down from a fight, which seems to be all that really happened in Boston in those days. And by those days, I mean anything up to the present day.  Little was the first person people called when there was a scuffle, and his usual table at the King's Horse tavern was known locally as "Little's Court" - a moniker the British cracked down on in 1770. Because we like to ruin everyone's fun.

She's the daughter of a merchant, Amos Carter, who was locally known for owning and bankrupting numerous businesses, and racking up significant debts.<br><br>Deborah was turned onto the streets at the age of 10 and took up work as an errand-runner, disguising herself as a boy to do it (hence the nickname 'Dobby'). Many of the tradesmen she worked for knew who she really was, but pretended to be fooled by the disguise. Possibly at first because they understood that her other options were limited, but later because she was quick, reliable and intelligent. <br><br>As a teenager, "Dobby" had to drop her disguise - but she kept her nickname. She continued her career carrying messages - and began negotiating contracts between businesses. She became something of a community icon - making sure the poor in the neighbourhood had food and clothing, and fighting against merchants who were charging exorbitant prices for staple items – a bit like Robin Hood, though when Dobby wore tights, no one giggled. And it was as a community icon that she met Connor.<br><br>Incidentally, I'm not being completely figurative when I say she was 'fighting' merchants. She wasn't averse to throwing a punch or two when it was necessary, particularly in her own defense - or the defense of others in her neighbourhood.

(Seems like a lot by modern standards, but colonial families were large, and the sad truth is that only 4 of Jacob's brothers and sisters would survive to adulthood.)<br><br>Zenger's family was poor and his career prospects were limited in Mannheim. Following the promise of a better life, he signed up as a soldier.  After several years in the service, he was shipped to New York - one of the Hessians sent to fight for the British in the Revolution. <br><br> Zenger - like many of the Hessian troops - left the service after coming overseas. Eager to get back to the country, Zenger bought a plot of land and left New York. However, after a series of crop failures, he was forced to move back to the city, taking up the only career that he could find to pay the bills - working as a bodyguard.

!*Jamie Colley is the son of a New York dock worker - James Colley. History doesn't record the name of his mother, though the Assassin records note she worked on a plantation in the southern colonies. <br><br>As a boy, Colley spent 3 years as a student at the Trinity School, where he was reported to be a bright student, reading everything he could get his hands on - his instructors noted that he was destined for great things. (I know you're wondering: yes, your school's permanent record really is that permanent). However, after that brief period he disappears from the school's attendance rolls - my guess would be he left because he needed to start earning money.  <br><br>It seems Colley's prospects didn't much improve through his teenage years - I have records of him being fined for vagrancy several times, which is never the sign of a high-flier. After that, he worked doing odd jobs for various local businesses, finally ending up working for a local physician, where his intelligence was recognized as an asset. He worked for several years as the doctor's assistant, where he met Connor.

Unfortunately for the British, the result was the beginning of the American Revolution.  <br><br>In other words: this battle was a complete disaster for the British.

The night before the battle, Paul Revere and William Dawes brought word that the British were on their way. So, by the time the Regulars marched into Lexington near dawn, the local militia was waiting for them. <br><br>Nobody knows who fired the first shot – the British blamed the rebels, and vice-versa - but in the end, the Lexington militia was badly outnumbered and retreated, and the British moved on to Concord.<br><br>By most reports, the British were polite in Concord, which I’m sure their mothers would have been delighted to hear about. All apart from one moment, of course, when John Pitcairn threatened a local tavern owner at gunpoint… but to be fair, the tavern owner DID know where the weapon caches were. <br><br>Overall, things didn't really go awry until nearby militia saw some smoke rising above the town - they thought it was on fire and marched in, causing a skirmish at the North Bridge.<br><br>By the time the British left Concord, more militia had arrived, outnumbering the Regulars, and raising tensions further.  The new troops followed the British along the road bravely firing at them from behind walls and the cover of trees. There was little the British could do to fight back - and they were tired, and mostly out of ammunition. Some of the regulars even broke ranks and fled.  For the rest - it was a long walk back to Boston.<br><br>Rather than dispersing after the battle the militia gathered outside of Boston neck, starting the Siege of Boston, and the beginnings of the Continental Army.

!*Bunker Hill was one of the first battles of the Revolutionary War. Technically, the rebels lost, but it was a pyrrhic victory for the British.<br><br>Let me set this up a bit: there were two places where rebel forces would have been able to mount attacks on British-occupied Boston– one was the Charlestown peninsula to the north, the other was Dorchester Heights, to the south. When rumours started that the British were going to fortify the hills around Charlestown, the rebels decided to act. <br><br>By which I mean do something; not put on a little play.<br><br>On the night of June 16, 1775, troops under the command of William Prescott sneaked onto the peninsula, occupied Bunker Hill and built fortifications on Breed's Hill. It was a tactically terrible choice – Breed's Hill was easier for enemies to climb, much more open to attack, and close enough to the British ships in the harbour to come under fire.  In fact, Prescott's orders were to fortify Bunker Hill – it's uncertain why he made the switch. Maybe he had trouble with B words, like Bunker and Breed’s. He probably thought he was fighting against the Belgians, not the Brits. <br><br>Fortunately for the rebel army, it seemed the British were almost as tactically inept as they were.  When General Howe landed troops at Moulton's Hill, he waited for reinforcements, rather than attacking immediately. This gave the rebel forces time to shore up their fortifications. When Howe finally did attack, he divided his forces, expecting the disorganized rebel army to fall before him – which it didn't. In fact, the British forces attacked and retreated twice before winning the day - after they'd received more reinforcements and the rebels were mostly out of ammunition.<br><br>The casualty reports are telling: 228 British soldiers dead, including many of their officers, and more than 800 injured. On the rebel side, 301 injuries and 140 deaths.  The Continental Army had shown they could hold their own against the better-trained British Army - and it's hard to say which side was more surprised by that. It still surprises me to this day.

!*This is one of many wars in the longstanding British vs. French rivalry. Well, YOU might call it a rivalry. I'D call it a battle of wits with an unarmed country.<br><br>This particular war being over who would come out as the Biggest Colonial Power. Of course, it wasn't enough that the British and French fight one another - they convinced a number of North American Indigenous nations to join the conflict as well, hence the name 'French and Indian War'. <br><br>The war started in the colonies but it spread to Europe where it was known as the "Seven Years' War". Before you point it out, yes, I know the dates add up to more than 7 years. The conflict started in 1754, but war wasn't officially declared until 1756. But well done for spotting it, you mathlete. I bet you were popular at school.<br><br>George Washington has the honour of starting the actual fighting - under orders, of course. He was sent to create a fort in disputed territory. While he was doing that, he crossed paths with a French patrol.  Washington attacked, the French retaliated. The British followed up by sending two full regiments of Regulars to the fight. And so it began.<br><br>The British fought a losing battle until about 1758 when they got a new Prime Minister, who decided funding the war effort was a priority. Possibly because of the whole French thing. Maybe he ate a bad baguette once. With the added support, the British - along with their Indigenous allies and the colonial militia - began to gain ground slowly but surely. Eventually, the French were driven out of almost all of their territory north of the Caribbean, something we in Britain celebrate with a special holiday, called “Every day, all year”.<br><br>So the British won - but they were left with huge war debts. They tried to pay these off with taxes levied from the Colonists they'd defended from the French, who would have had them all eating onions and saying ‘Oui sir, non sir’ before you knew it. The Colonists objected - leading up to a series of protests, which were part of the unrest that led to the American Revolution. Talk about gratitude. Zut alors!

!*This battle was part of the French and Indian War. In it, Edward Braddock's force of 1500 British Regulars and militia was decimated by a group of French-led troops half its size.<br><br>This is not something we talk about much in Britain.<br><br>Braddock had been sent to capture Fort Duquesne, at the top of the Ohio River. His officers included a young George Washington - possibly because Washington knew the area, having surrendered at Fort Necessity the year before.<br><br>Braddock's troops were about 10 miles from Fort Duquesne when they were ambushed by a group of French and Indigenous fighters. Braddock's advance troops were overwhelmed and fell back into the main body of the army. His rear guard didn't hear the order to stop, and kept advancing into the main body of the army. The result was chaos. Almost every one of his officers was killed - with the exception of Washington. Braddock himself was fatally wounded; Washington had him carried from the field and he died 4 days later. An interesting historical note - Braddock gave his officers' sash to George Washington, asking him to preserve it. Washington did - it's still on display at Mount Vernon.<br><br>The battle is also known as "Braddock's Defeat", but interestingly, no one knows why.<br><br>I’m kidding. Though if you need me to tell you why, I don’t think you’re really cut out for this.

!*The Boston Massacre was the culmination of several fights between British soldiers and the people of Boston. A group of British soldiers fired into a crowd at point-blank range, killing 5. <br><br>The reality of it is less damning to the British than it sounds - what started as an argument about a wigmaker's bill (of all things) turned into a mob.  Hundreds of Boston citizens kept 8 British Regulars cornered for hours. By the end of it, many were holding clubs, throwing stones, and taunting the soldiers to fire.  <br><br>Captain Thomas Preston was in charge of the Regulars, and tried to defuse the situation by talking with the crowd. They asked if his soldiers' guns were loaded - he admitted that they were, but it would have been stupid for him to order them to fire, since at the time he was standing in front of them.<br><br>It wasn't until one of the soldiers was hit by a stone (which forced him to drop his musket) that the Regulars fired into the crowd - against the orders of Preston, who later testified he never gave the command to fire.  (It's possible his men mistook the taunts of the crowd for an order.)<br><br>The Regulars were arrested and tried for murder - six were acquitted, including Thomas Preston. The other two men were found guilty of manslaughter, but had their thumbs branded in lieu of the usual sentence - which was death.<br><br>One of the interesting things about the massacre is what happened afterward - that is, how both sides tried to spin it to their advantage. The fact that most people call it a "Massacre" should give you some idea of who won this particular PR war. Revolutionaries portrayed it as an attack on Colonial liberties, and images of the event (popularized by Paul Revere), showed an organized British force firing into the crowd - not a confused group of soldiers cornered by an angry mob.  <br><br>The British, on the other hand, referred to the event "The Incident on King Street".  We're naturally calm in a crisis - unlike countries who insist on turning every minor confrontation into a three-ring circus.<br><br>Anyway, the wigmaker dropped his prices and it never happened again. <br><br>I call it a victory for the bald.

!*This was one of the key events leading up to the American Revolution. Protesters (some dressed in faux-Native garb) boarded 3 ships docked in Boston Harbour and threw their cargoes of tea overboard to protest British taxes. Throwing tea into a harbour probably broke a world record for making the biggest cup of tea ever, though if there is one statement guaranteed to rile a Briton, it is the unnecessary waste of perfectly good tea.<br><br>So - simple enough, but the lead up is a bit more complex. The East India Company actually wanted to sell the tea to all of the colonies at a cut-rate to boost its flagging profits. However, taxes on the tea would have to be paid to the British the instant the tea was unloaded in Boston harbour. And the Colonists had a long-standing problem with paying taxes to Britain when they had no representatives in British parliament. Offering discount tea while still collecting the tax on it was viewed by the Colonists as a trick to get them to agree to parliament's authority over them.<br><br>Protesters turned back ships carrying tea to New York and Philadelphia, and if that had happened in Boston, the problem would have been solved. Unfortunately, the governor of Boston wouldn't let the tea ships leave once they were in the harbour. I guess he figured the public would come 'round eventually and just pay the tax - because everyone likes a bargain - but that never happened. In fact, protests got bigger and bigger until a meeting at the Old South Meeting House. A mob broke away from the crowd there and dumped the tea, solving the impasse, and wasting the tea.<br><br>(I shuddered as I wrote that)<br><br>The British reacted to the protest by sending British troops under Thomas Gage to occupy the town. They also closed the Boston Harbour, part of several laws they created to punish the Colonists that were dubbed the "Coercive Acts". Of course, these laws didn't gain them any sympathy with the Colonists - and led fairly directly to the outbreak of the Revolution.<br><br>Tea is important business.

!*The Battle of Monmouth wasn't particularly significant strategically, but it was an important proving ground for Washington and the Continental Army. It was also a near-disaster. But I'm getting ahead of myself, and that’s naughty.<br><br>Once the British learned that the French had joined the Revolutionary War, British troops were ordered to withdraw from Philadelphia and march to New York City. That’s quite a march. I bet they couldn’t wait for the invention of the motor car. <br><br>The Continental Army was just finishing its winter at Valley Forge and George Washington was anxious to try his newly-trained troops.  He decided to attack the British column in an attempt to delay it - or stop it entirely.<br><br>Washington chose Charles Lee to lead the advance guard in the attack. At first Lee said no, saying that the British troops should be left alone. However, when Washington ignored his protests and offered the command to the Marquis de Lafayette instead, Lee agreed to fight.<br><br>Lee's troops caught up to the British column at the Monmouth court house, and attacked. The day was hot - more than 100 Fahrenheit - and soldiers on both sides dropped from heat exhaustion. Despite the weather, the Continental Army was doing well until Lee mysteriously ordered a retreat - a move that still confuses modern historians. People must have thought he was quite the pacifist for such a warrior. Though of course, people didn’t know what you and I know now… it’s nice to feel clever, isn’t it?<br><br>First time for you?<br><br>Anyway, Lee's plan backfired - Washington arrived to find his troops retreating, but rallied them and attacked again. The two armies fought until nightfall, when the British sneaked away under cover of darkness - leaving the Continental Army victorious, but the British Army well on its way to New York. Still, it was proof that Washington's troops were - finally - a match for the British.<br><br>The battle secured Washington's reputation - and destroyed Lee's.  He was arrested, court-martialed, and kicked out of the army entirely.

!*The Sullivan Expedition was Washington's response to several raids by British and Iroquois groups along the northern frontier. Forces under Joseph Brant and John Butler had attacked forts and settlements in the Wyoming and Cherry valleys - killing and scalping women and children as well as militia. <br><br>Washington's orders were very clear. In order to root out the problem, Sullivan was to attack and burn as many Iroquois settlements as he could find, and take as many prisoners as he could. Sullivan complied, burning 40 Iroquois villages, and destroying an estimated 160,000 bushels of corn. His troops also answered previous atrocities with their own - scalping bodies, and burning people alive in cabins.  Sullivan didn't limit his troops to active enemies, either - he also attacked the Onondaga, who had stayed neutral during the war. (This attack had the unsurprising effect of making the Onondaga into enemies of the Patriots.)<br><br>In the end, the Sullivan expedition failed to stop raids in the area - those continued throughout the revolution, as each side sought to get revenge for the violence of the other. The repeated attacks on both sides eventually laid waste to the entire Kanièn:keh Territory (also known as Mohawk Valley) and the land around it.<br><br>Possibly because of the Sullivan Expedition, George Washington became known among the Iroquois as the "Town Destroyer".  Although, the origin of the nickname is historically contested - he might have already earned it destroying towns during the French and Indian war. Now there's the mark of a great statesman - it's hard to tell when he got a reputation for scorched earth policies, because he did it so much.

!*In this battle, French ships under Admiral De Grasse held off a British fleet attempting to occupy Chesapeake Bay.  I know it doesn't exactly sound scintillating, but bear with me here - this was critical to the British surrender that ended the war. I don’t like to talk about it, but I will.<br><br>George Washington gave De Grasse a choice between attacking New York City (the British stronghold) or Virginia (Where British troops were stationed). De Grasse chose Virginia – the waters were easier to manoeuvre in, and he didn’t have the equipment that a siege of New York would require. <br><br>De Grasse was stationed in the West Indies, but left in secrecy - or he tried to. The British noticed his warships missing. I don’t know about you, but I’d find it suspicious if a bunch of warships went missing. It raises questions. And it wasn't hard to guess where they might be headed. <br><br>The British Navy sent ships to Chesapeake Bay to cut De Grasse off. However, they went the fast way, while De Grasse took the scenic route - staying out of sight and out of the major shipping lanes. So when the British arrived at the Chesapeake they found it… completely empty. They sailed on for New York to meet with the rest of their fleet there, leaving the Chesapeake Bay empty when De Grasse arrived at the end of August. Clever. And by taking the long way round, De Grasse collected enough Sea Miles to qualify for a free hip flask.<br><br>The British fleet returned less than a week later, but the damage was done. They were outnumbered by the French forces occupying the bay. I believe the technical term here is "Whoops". (There’s another one, but that begins with ‘F’, so I’d better not.)<br><br>De Grasse’s fleet sailed out to engage the British on open water. They fought for only two hours before night fell. It was the only time they would actually fire their guns. De Grasse led the British south, away from the mouth of the harbour, leaving time for French reinforcements to arrive from Rhode Island - and occupy the bay again.<br><br>Finding themselves badly outnumbered and outmaneuvered, the British returned to New York, effectively abandoning the troops they were supposed to supply in Virginia. <br><br>The battle was technically a draw. I’ll take that. However, the larger victory came when the British troops in Virginia realized they were cut off and surrendered - effectively ending the Revolution.

!*The Siege of Boston began right after the Battles of Lexington and Concord.  The Colonial militia who had gathered to stop the British raids followed the British army to Boston… and camped outside, bottling British troops and their Loyalist allies in the city. At the time, Boston was a peninsula, attached to the mainland by a thin strip of land known as Boston Neck. With this blocked, land access to the city was cut off.<br><br>The siege lasted for most of a year, with only one major battle - Bunker Hill. But - as with most sieges - it took a toll on the city of Boston. There were shortages, particularly of firewood, and many buildings were torn down to be used as fuel.  Of course, the British targeted any rebel-associated buildings for destruction. As a result, things like the Liberty Tree and the pews from the Old South Meeting House ended up inside a fireplace. <br><br>The siege ended shortly after the rebels attacked and fortified Dorchester Heights to the south of Boston - giving them the ability to fire on the harbour. Boston's governor decided to evacuate, rather than fight. On March 17, Loyalist ships sailed out of the city. <br><br>March 17 is now known as "Evacuation Day" and is a holiday in some parts of Massachusetts. The fact that it is also St. Patrick's Day is… mere coincidence. (Though it is said that in ancient Gaelic, “Evacuation” means “Drinking as many pints as possible and being sick in a bin”, so you never know.)

!*The Great Fire destroyed as much as a quarter of the buildings in New York, and caused a housing crisis that lasted as long as the British occupation of the city.  <br><br>New York at the time was largely deserted - first Loyalists had moved out as the Continental Army moved in, and then the Continental Army left and many of the Patriots went with it. Many buildings were empty, and the conditions were dry. So when the flames started they spread quickly, ripping through the poorer sections of the city and seeming to spread to several places at once. This is probably part of what caused rumours that the Continental Army was responsible - such a big fire couldn't have been an accident. <br><br>Except it seems it was.  There’s no proof that the rebels were involved at all. Washington had considered setting fire to the city as he retreated, but Congress had voted against it.  Washington was fairly clear in his writings about the event: “Providence, or some good honest fellow, has done more for us than we were disposed to do for ourselves." That is – ‘Wasn’t us! But I’m not sorry it happened…’

!*On the night before the Battles of Lexington and Concord, Paul Revere and William Dawes left Boston to warn the countryside that the British Regulars were on the march. In particular, they wanted to warn John Hancock and Samuel Adams that the Regulars intended to arrest them.<br><br>Revere left Boston by boat across the Charles River, taking the road across the Charlestown peninsula. Dawes took the longer land route across Boston Neck. Revere arrived in Lexington first, but Dawes wasn't far behind.<br><br>Once they'd delivered their warning to Hancock and Adams in Lexington, Dawes and Revere decided to continue to Concord to warn people there of the coming raid. They joined up with Samuel Prescott, who was visiting his fiancée in Lexington. Prescott lived in Concord, and so knew the area well. Road trip!<br><br>The three men were halfway to Concord when they were stopped by a British patrol. Revere was captured, but Dawes and Prescott broke away. Dawes lost his horse and hid in a barn for several hours before sneaking back to Lexington, but Prescott reached Concord to sound the alarm. (Good thing they had him tag along).<br><br>Years later, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow would write a poem about the event, which rolled all of the riders into one – Paul Revere. Which is why everyone knows his name - and why Revere is so revered.

!*This was the site of the winter encampment for the Continental Army in 1777-78. <br><br>Valley Forge wasn't Washington's first choice of location. My first choice would have been the Bahamas, but apparently that’s quite inconveniently located. The valley was mostly uninhabited, and he felt it that would be easier to house and feed an army in a larger town. Congress, on the other hand, wanted the army nearby - keeping it between them (in York) and the British army (in Philadelphia). Valley Forge was close enough to Philadelphia to harass British troops there, but far enough away to prevent a surprise attack from the British. A life without surprises. What a thing to wish for.<br><br>Washington did have a point, though - the army had trouble getting supplies, and Valley Forge had no housing for the troops. And even though that winter was mild, it was cold for an army where a third of soldiers didn't have any shoes. Mild temperatures also meant it was damp, so disease ran rampant - thousands died.  <br><br>All of which makes Valley Forge sound like a complete disaster, but the astonishing thing is - it wasn't. The better-equipped soldiers took the patrols; the others built houses. Nathaniel Greene was named quartermaster and found supplies. They invented subsistence rations for themselves when food ran low. Baron Von Steuben and others arrived and began to drill the troops in military tactics and in basic camp layout and sanitation - helping stop the spread of the disease problem. <br><br>Far from being the catastrophe it seemed, Valley Forge is legendary today as the 'proving ground' of the American army. I imagine it would be of little comfort to those who suffered there. “Yes, you caught a terrible disease – but well done, you really proved yourself!” <br><br>The army emerged as a capable fighting force, though - winning a victory almost immediately at the Battle of Monmouth.

!*The Beggar's Opera opened in London in 1728. It's a musical - one of the earliest ever created. It was written by John Gay, a writer and friend of both Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift, two of the prominent literary figures of the day. <br><br>The Opera was both popular and controversial.  Popular, partly because it was an excellent skewering of Italian Opera, which was very popular at the time. However, instead of complicated Italian songs, the Beggar's Opera featured folk tunes that the audience could recognise, meaning you could hum along even if you didn't know Italian. <br><br>It was controversial because of the subject matter. It's set in the Newgate prison, and the main characters are all criminals - who act much like the upper classes.  It was a sendup of the British nobility, including veiled criticism of the head of government - neither of whom traditionally have a sense of humour. I’ve never met a Queen who liked a knock-knock joke.<br><br>Actually, I’ve never met a Queen.<br><br>The Beggar's Opera was accused of being a "base form of entertainment", and - because its main characters were criminals - accused of causing increase in crime. It's nice to see that criticism isn't just for movies and video games. Bloody opera – corrupting our kids…

!*This treaty was meant to resolve ongoing land disputes between the Indigenous peoples and ever-encroaching Colonists.<br><br>King George III had established a boundary line in 1763, but it had no basis in reality. Colonists were already living west of the line when it was drawn – not to mention the land wasn't really the King's to divvy up (I'm sure that just slipped his mind – Kings can be notoriously forgetful, the poor darlings, when it comes to the rights of others…). <br><br>Members of the Iroquois confederacy met with William Johnson at Fort Stanwix to negotiate a new boundary line – on behalf of themselves and other smaller nations (like the Shawnee). <br><br>I use the term 'negotiate' rather lightly - in reality, the Iroquois didn't have much choice in signing the agreement. It was give away some of their land and achieve peace (at least temporarily), or fight a long and drawn-out war.  The question was only how much.<br><br>When the treaty was signed, it was … generous to Johnson to say the least - even handing over lands the British had left to the Cherokee earlier the same year. In fact, the Stanwix treaty was so controversial that the British-run Board of Trade ordered Johnson to renegotiate. He refused. <br><br>Johnson made a fortune speculating on land – I imagine this treaty was quite a windfall for him.

!*This is the treaty that ended the war between Britain and the United States. (Not to be confused with the Treaty of Paris of 1763, which ended the French and Indian War, or the Treaty of Paris of 1810, which ended the French war with Sweden. Paris loves a treaty.)<br><br>The fighting between American and British forces had mostly ended by 1781, with Cornwallis' surrender at Yorktown. This agreement formalized the end of the war, and declared the United States as a new nation, with the 13 colonies as 13 new states. <br><br>The treaty also provided for the release of prisoners of war on both sides, a return of seized property to Loyalists and Patriots alike, and an expansion of the boundaries of the United States. Of course, the reality was a bit more complicated – both sides refused to return property that theoretically belonged to the other, like a messy divorce and some easy listening CDs. And as to the offer of expanded territory - well, Spain had other ideas about whose land it was – as did the Indigenous peoples living there.

!*The Buttonwood Agreement is the precursor to the New York Stock Exchange. It was signed in 1792 under a Buttonwood tree on Wall St. – hence the name. Lucky it wasn’t a Monkey Puzzle Tree – that would not be a dignified name at all.<br><br>The agreement itself is fairly simple – 24 local merchants agreed that they would trade only with one another, and that they would take a 0.25% commission on whatever they traded.<br><br>And in case you're thinking 1792 is too early for there to be stocks to trade, it wasn't – the first war bonds were released by Alexander Hamilton in 1790, two years before, so you’re wrong, and should probably keep your opinions to yourself.

!*You may or may not have heard of this one.<br><br>This is the document in which the 13 colonies formally declared their independence from Britain Congress voted to accept the Declaration on July 4, 1776 – celebrated today as Independence Day in the United States. Contrary to popular belief, the document wasn’t actually signed on July 4 - the first signatures weren’t added until the Declaration was formally transcribed, sometime around the beginning of August - others were added as the delegates arrived in Philadelphia. By some accounts the final signature wasn't added until sometime in 1777.  <br><br>The Declaration, with its statement that "All men are created equal" and that they had the right to "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness" became an inspiration for other revolutions that came after it. Most notably the French Revolution - against the very government that supported the Americans in their bid for independence. Oops.

!*The Stamp Act was the British Government's attempt to recoup some of the money they spent during the French and Indian War by taxing the American Colonists - who theoretically benefitted most from it.<br><br>Parliament chose a Stamp Tax because it was simple, easily implemented, and the Colonists couldn't smuggle their way out of paying it. All papers - from newspapers, to legal documents, to lawyer's licenses - would need to purchase a government stamp to be used.<br><br>Colonists, however, didn't think Britain had the right to tax them at all, since there were no colonial representatives in Parliament (hence the snappy Revolutionary slogan "No Taxation Without Representation").  They also resented the suggestion that they were responsible for Britain's war debts - since the colonial militia had a huge role in fighting - and winning the French and Indian War.<br><br>Huge public protests were organized - run by groups who called themselves the "Sons of Liberty". Merchants declared a boycott of British goods. Perhaps most importantly, the people assigned to collect the tax were threatened and intimidated into resigning.  The Massachusetts Stamp Distributor was even paraded through Boston by the Sons of Liberty and forced to resign at the Liberty Tree.<br><br>No stamp taxes were ever collected and British repealed the Stamp Act in March 1766. But it wasn't an entire victory for the colonies. Parliament then passed something called the Declaratory Act -essentially stating that Britain had the absolute right to tax the Colonists and there wasn't anything the Colonists could do about it.<br><br>Nothing, that is, except start their own country. <br><br>I’ve always fancied doing that.

!*The Tea Act passed in 1773. It was an attempt by the British Government to prop up the British East India Company by allowing it to ship tea to the colonies directly from India - without having it go through Britain first. This made the tea much less expensive - even cheaper than the tea the Colonists were smuggling from the Dutch (to avoid paying British taxes).<br><br>The problem was that - even with the cheaper prices - the British government was still collecting tax on the tea. Meaning: buying the tea would run counter to the colonial "No Taxation without Representation" stance. <br><br>The move was seen as (and probably was) Parliament's sneaky attempt to get the colonies to unconsciously agree to one tax, in the hope of implementing others.  The Colonists didn't fall for it - and attempts to force the unloading of East India tea in Boston caused the Boston Tea Party – perhaps the worst tea party of all time. <br><br>It wasn’t even catered. You people are savages.

!*The Coercive Acts - sometimes called the 'Intolerable Acts' - were a series of laws passed by British Parliament in response to the Boston Tea Party.  Among other things, these laws replaced the elected Massachusetts Legislature with an appointed one, and closed Boston Harbour until the East India Company was reimbursed for the tea - which, let's be honest, was never going to happen. The Acts were a major blow against Massachusetts' economy and self-government.<br><br>The acts got their name because British Parliament hoped that the crackdown would 'coerce' the citizenry into behaving like good little Colonists, and stop the violent protests - lest the same thing happen to them. Unfortunately, the acts had the opposite effect - it made it easier for Whigs to argue for independence, and difficult for the Loyalists to argue that Parliament had their best interests at heart.<br><br>It seems nobody likes a bully.

!*More commonly known as Thaddeus Kościuszko – and even more commonly mispronounced – this gentleman was a Polish soldier who served as an engineer in the Revolutionary War. Kościuszko was the son of a Polish noble, and learned military tactics as part of his private schooling. He joined the Continental Army in 1776. <br><br>His full name was Tadeusz   Andrzej Bonawentura Kościuszko and while his surname may sound like a sneeze, but Kościuszko was in charge of founding and training the much-needed corps of engineers for the Continental Army. He's probably best-known for overseeing the fortifications at Saratoga, which were crucial to the American victory there in 1777. He also helped build the fortifications at West Point (the ones Benedict Arnold tried to sell to the British).<br><br> When the war ended, Congress promoted Kościuszko to Brigadier General – probably just so they could call him “Brigadier General” instead of attempt his name – but also clearly in recognition for his service. He returned to Poland, where in 1794 he led a rebellion of his own - now known as the Kościuszko uprising. He lost, and was jailed for 2 years in Russia before being exiled to France.<br><br>Get this - after he died, Kościuszko left some of his money to Thomas Jefferson with directions that it be used to free and educate black slaves. Unfortunately, Jefferson never bothered to use the money. It was returned to Kościuszko's heirs in 1852.

!*Captain William Kidd was a Scottish privateer-turned pirate, and the centre of numerous pirate legends.<br><br>Not much is known about Kidd before the late 17th century - even his year of birth is approximate. It's reasonably certain he's from Scotland, but that's about it. (Every good pirate needs a mysterious past.). Kidd first appears in historical records in 1689, when he's listed as captain. He was a privateer for Britain in the West Indies, before sailing for New York City where he lived for several years.<br><br>In 1695, Kidd was given a privateer's commission to hunt ships in the Indian Ocean, and headed for Madagascar - which at the time was a known pirate haven. Then Kidd disobeyed the terms of his privateer's commission, attacking ships in the Red Sea - no one is quite sure why, but I guess that’s pirates for you. They’re bonkers.<br><br>When Kidd returned to the West Indies in 1699, he found that he was a hunted man. He sold his ship - the Quedah Merchant - in Hispaniola, and headed up the coast in a new ship. Kidd knew he was likely to be caught, and wanted to have bargaining chips to secure his own freedom, so he started hiding treasure as he went. The idea being that he could later give away the locations in order to save his own skin. <br><br>Kidd was finally captured when he returned home to New York. He tried to talk (and buy) his way out of arrest, but it didn't work. He was hanged for piracy in 1701, which must have been so annoying.<br><br>As for Kidd's treasure, it's known that he buried some of it on Gardiners Island, off the coast of Long Island, New York - That part was eventually recovered after Kidd's death. Nobody knows what else he hid, but speculation still rages today over how much he buried, and where.

!*BATTLE OF YORKTOWN

Id: [0x00065E0F]
!*While small skirmishes would continue until 1783, Yorktown was the last major encounter between the British and the Continental Army - effectively ending the American Revolution...<br><br>In the summer of 1781, The British General, Lord Cornwallis, was ordered to secure a deep water port in Virginia. He'd chosen Yorktown, on the Chesapeake Bay and by the end of September his troops had fortified the city and were awaiting resupply from ships in New York City. (What Cornwallis didn't know was that the ships he was expecting for resupply had been defeated by the French navy at the Battle of the Chesapeake in early September. He could have probably done with knowing that.)<br><br>On the rebel side, George Washington had just secured the help of the French, and was anxious to put his new troops in the field. He favoured an attack on the British stronghold at New York - but, since he didn't have the troops or the equipment for that, he settled for attacking Cornwallis at Yorktown. (I'm sure Cornwallis would have been flattered by the news that he was second choice).<br><br>The main force of Continental and French troops marched to Yorktown near the end of September and began to settle in. By October 6th the trenches were built and the siege had begun. <br><br>The key to Washington's strategy was the artillery brought in by the French army. It bombarded the city for more than a week, wearing down defenses until French and Continental troops successfully stormed two redoubts outside the city on October 14. This put the artillery in a place where it could reach the city itself, and Cornwallis' defenses quickly crumbled under the onslaught. He surrendered on October 19th. <br><br>This fall of Yorktown essentially broke the political will in Britain to continue the war - it had become too costly. Parliament started peace negotiations, and British citizens began to stamp their tiny feet and practice their speeches about how the colonies were smelly and uncivilized and we didn't want to control them ANYWAY. <br><br>Yeah, stinky colonies!

!*Massacre on King Street.  <br><br>Doubtless our readers well know that on the evening of Monday last, a squadron of soldiers formed before the Custom House fired into a crowd of citizens, killing four and wounding many.  Our readers will expect a circumstantial account of the tragical affair; but we hope they will excuse our being particularly cautious as we should be, had we not seen that the town was intending an enquiry and full representation thereof.  However, some few facts appear to be established.  <br><br>Following upon an altercation between some lads of the town and a single posted guard at the Custom House, an increasing number of citizens came to that place and with heat shouted down the guard.  In like manner, a large group of citizens gathered in King Street.  Capt. Thomas Preston perceived from the Main Guard House his soldier in distress and left the Main Guard with a party of men with charged bayonets. The soldiers came, pushing their bayonets, crying, make way! They took place by the Custom House and, continuing to push to drive the people off pricked some in several places, on which they were clamorous and, it is said, threw snow balls and, perhaps, portions of ice. The crowd taunting the soldiers, shouting, “Fire! You dare not fire!” On this, and more snow balls coming, someone cried out, “Damn you, fire!”  One soldier then fired, and a townsman with a cudgel struck him over the hands with such force that he dropped his firelock; and, rushing forward, aimed a blow at the Captain's head which grazed his hat and fell pretty heavy upon his arm. However, the soldiers continued the fire successively till seven or eight or, as some say, eleven guns were discharged.  <br><br>By this fatal manoeuvre three men were laid dead on the spot and two more struggling for life; but what showed a degree of cruelty unknown to British troops, at least since the house of Hanover has directed their operation, was an attempt to fire upon or push with their bayonets the persons who undertook to remove the slain and wounded!<br><br>The dead are –<br><br>Mr. Samuel Gray, killed on the spot, the ball entering his head and beating off a large portion of his skull. <br><br>A mulatto man named Crispus Attucks, also killed instantly, two balls entering his breast, one of them in special goring the right lobe of the lungs and a great part of the liver most horribly. <br><br>Mr. James Caldwell, mate of Capt. Morton's vessel, in like manner killed by two balls entering his back. <br><br>Mr. Samuel Maverick, a promising youth of seventeen years of age, son of the widow Maverick , and an apprentice to Mr. Greenwood, ivory-turner; a ball went through his belly and was cut out at his back. He died the next morning. <br><br>Mr. Patrick Carr, about thirty years of age, who worked with Mr. Field, leather breeches-maker in Queen Street, wounded; a ball entered near his hip and went out at his side. Apprehended he will die.<br><br>And several others requiring surgery, suffering loss of blood, shattered bones and lodged musket-balls.  <br><br>Governor Hutchinson has exerted himself in an effort to quell the town. He has ordered the arrest of said Captain Preston as well as the soldiers involved until such time as an investigation and general ordering of the facts can be made.

!*Tea chests destroyed. A most curious and remarkable event took place on Griffin’s Wharf, Boston Thursday 16 December. <br><br>An assemblage of individuals dressed in buckskin with faces painted in the fashion of Indian natives convened at the wharf and proceeded to board the Dartmouth, the Eleanor and the Beaver in orderly manner. These Indians, or perhaps no, as was the general discernment of those who witnessed these events, equipped themselves with small hatchets, which they denominated as tomahawks. <br><br>These ships held within their cargoes chests of tea numbering three to four hundred. The commanders of the vessels had publicly declared that if the rebels, as they were pleased to style the Bostonians, should not withdraw their opposition to the landing of the tea before the following day, they should on that day force it on shore, under the cover of their cannon's mouth.<br><br>Once aboard, the presumptive Indians opened the hatches and made to take out the chests of tea and threw them overboard, first cutting and splitting the chests with their tomahawks, so as thoroughly to expose them to the effects of the water.  In about three hours they had thus broken and thrown overboard every tea chest to be found in the ships. During the time they were throwing the tea overboard, there were several attempts made by some of the citizens of Boston and its vicinity to carry off small quantities of tea for their family use. To effect that object, they would watch their opportunity to snatch up a handful from the deck, where it became plentifully scattered, and put it into their pockets. Some of these same were met with kicks and hooting by the presumptive Indians.<br><br>Earlier on this day, there was a meeting of the citizens of the county of Suffolk, convened at Old South in Boston, for the purpose of consulting on what measures might be considered expedient to prevent the landing of the tea, or secure the people from the collection of the duty. At that meeting, no satisfactory answer was obtained after enquiries were sent to Governor Hutchinson, and Mr. Adams concluded with the observation that the “meeting could do nothing further to save the country.” <br><br>Beyond the chests of tea, there was no damage done to any of the ships. The destroyers of the chests were seen to sweep the decks clean of tea leaves after the chests had been thrown to sea.

!*The raising of the militia.<br><br>The recent events, as tumultuous and striking as they are, cannot have earned victorious wreathes had it not been for the efforts of some few riders that gave warning to the towns and raised the minutemen to their duty.<br><br>These riders, chief among them Mr. Paul Revere and Mr. William Dawes, were sent out by Dr. Joseph Warren, who had come into the knowledge by sources undisclosed that a regiment of soldiers was to march that night to Lexington, there to arrest leaders of the Sons of Liberty who were there spending the night.  The Regulars were then to continue to Concord to secure various arms there hidden about, including at Barrett’s Farm.<br><br>Dr. Warren could not risk that his message would fail to be delivered among the townships. He cleverly made fast certain of his aim sending his message by diverse routes at once. To begin, Mr. Dawes left Boston by way of Boston Neck, using guile to pass the roadblock and continue through Roxbury in a circuitous route. Soon after, Mr. Revere entreated Capt. Pulling to light lamps in the tower of Old North, this being the signal to Charlestown that the Regulars were on the march. Revere himself took the chance of a life to row beneath the prow of HMS Somerset to arrive at Charlestown himself and make the ride to Lexington directly.  Revere altered his route to evade the night patrols along the way. In the event, both riders haply arrived at Lexington to warn Samuel Adams and John Hancock of the approaching Regulars.  Joined by Samuel Prescott, Revere and Dawes rode on to Concord but were confronted by soldiers on that road. Dawes lost his horse and made his way back to Lexington on foot. Prescott led his horse to a daring leap of a wall and continued on to Concord to raise the Minutemen.  Revere was captured by the patrol and threatened with his life.  He only secured his freedom when the soldiers heard fire from the hills of Concord and ran to join battle. <br><br>But Mr. Revere’s adventure was not yet complete.  Upon return to Lexington, he was astonished to find John Hancock at the place, preparing to fight the on-coming soldiers as an officer. It fell to Revere to ‘suade Mr. Hancock that his place was not in the field. Mr. Hancock and Mr. Adams then removed themselves to a safer place, but failed to bring along a chest full of congressional papers, of which the discovery by the soldiers would cause difficulties.  Mr. Revere returned to take possession of these papers before the soldiers arrived at Lexington Green.

!*Regulars confront militia. Shots fired.<br><br>Americans! forever bear in mind the BATTLE of LEXINGTON! where British Troops, unmolested and unprovoked wantonly, and in a most inhuman manner fired upon and killed a number of our countrymen! The events, as well as can be discerned, transpired thusly: Alerted by messengers that a regiment of Regulars was en route through Menotomy to destroy caches of munitions in Concord & vicinity, Militia forces convened, drawing members from as far away as Sudbury, Acton, Lincoln and Bedford.  The first such force stood against the Regulars on Lexington Green, just 7 miles from Concord proper.  Commanded by Captain John Parker, the Colony Militia, numbering some few dozens of members, stood ground as a brigade under Major Pitcairn marched in column along the Concord road. Accounts of what ensued remain confused, but Militia members claim that they never fired any shot, but were fired upon by the Regulars suffering them 8 deaths and a number of wounded. Capt. Parker led his men from the field and the column of murderous Regulars continued to Concord. <br><br>At the town of Concord another brigade of Militia, under command of Col. James Barrett, saw fit to fall back across the North Bridge as the Regulars numbered a much larger force. Atop a hill, Barrett watched the Regulars search for munitions and was gladdened by the addition of Militia forces arriving from diverse townships. In short order, Col. Barrett discovered that he outnumbered the small force of Regulars sent to secure the bridge and commenced to march upon them. Some few of these endeavored to dislodge planks of the bridge to delay the advance of the Militia, but were called off by their superiors.  Volleys were exchanged and men on both sides fell, resulting in the Regulars quitting the field. The larger Army force concluded its fruitless search and turned toward Boston, only to meet with a series of flanking manoeuvres and attacks in formation by the Militia. This force would certainly have been entirely destroyed had it not been for Brig. Gen. Percy’s arrival with reinforcements to escort them back, through hails of musket balls, to Charlestown.<br><br>Thus have shots been fired between ourselves and our cousins from across the sea. The Rubicon has been crossed. Americans!--Liberty or Death! -- Join or Die!

!*A Second Continental Congress.<br><br>In light of the bloody events in Massachusetts, a Second Continental Congress representing all 13 colonies has convened in the city of Philadelphia. The Congress will attempt to order the military situation in accord with agreement among all the Colonies.  It will seek as well to center parlays with London in one place and with all colonies in unison.  The Second Congress will be presided over by John Hancock of Boston as Peyton Randolph is not in good health and cannot continue his duties from the previous such congress.<br><br>In these few months since the glorious battles at Lexington and Concord, the military effort has been ad-hoc. Various Militias have driven out Tory officials and seized Royal munitions.  Thereunto, the first accomplishment of the assembled representatives has been to create from the several Colony Militias a single Continental Army and to name a General to lead it. Geo. Washington of Virginia, who saw considerable duty in the French War, is to be Commander-in-Chief with Artemas Ward, Charles Lee, Philip Schuyler and Israel Putnam as majors-general. Congress has also exerted itself in the mercantile interests of the thirteen colonies – all American ports are now open mooting the odious Navigation Acts.<br><br>Despite the creation of the Continental Army, the Congress expects that the division between all colonies and the Crown to be eventually be set right to the benefit of all.  To this end, the Congress has approved the Olive Branch Petition to the British Crown in a gesture of reconciliation.

!*Bloody battle in Charlestown!<br>  <br>Colonial Militia engages Crown forces on Breed’s Hill.  Many killed and grievously wounded.<br><br>It having become known that Crown forces intended to take positions dominating the whole of Charlestown, Gen. Artemas Ward put one thousand Militia troops into the field. Acting with bravura and dispatch, Maj. Gen. Israel Putnam and Col. Wm. Prescott worked through the night to erect a redoubt running the width of Breed’s Hill down to the Mystic River itself, said defenses surprising the Royal troops at morning light.<br><br>The Colonial Militia continued to build breastworks even as they were bombarded by ships in Boston Bay. Come afternoon, some two thousand soldiers, comprised of fusiliers, light infantry and regulars, landed on the Charlestown shore and assaulted the colonial defenses.  Militia snipers inflicted harm upon the Regulars from afar, and Gen. Howe responded in a most cowardly manner, ordering combustible shells to be fired upon the houses of Charlestown itself, setting the town on fire. The inhabitants fled to the fields.<br><br>The brave Militia, although short on rum and ammunition, held their ground and waited till the approaching line was well within range before unleashing a devastating volley into the Royal ranks.  The Army fell back then attacked again.  Again the New England volunteers inflicted great harm upon the soldiers.   From across the Charles, citizens of Boston viewed the battle from their rooftops.<br><br>A third time, the Royal forces marched up the slopes of Breed’s Hill. Alas, the Militia reserves of ammunition were exhausted and the men fell back in disarray, leaving both Breed’s Hill and Bunker Hill to the King’s troops.<br><br>The ground was hard won by Gen. Howe.  In all he suffered some one thousand casualties, dead and wounded. Militia losses are tallied at four hundred.

!*Fire devastates Manhattan. Trinity Church burned. Rebels thought responsible.<br><br>A great fire spread through New York on the 21st, that being Saturday before last.  The fire began near Whitehall Slip, likely in the Fighting Cocks Tavern known for untoward behavior.  A south-westerly wind quickly spread the flames north through the streets, putting many out of their homes.  These citizens took what goods they could and found relative safety on the town commons. The wind then shifted and burned most of the city from Broadway to the Hudson. Burning ashes from shingles were carried by the winds across street and to far buildings.  The roof of Trinity Church soon caught fire and the Church burned in minutes.<br><br>With little fire department left in the city, Royal soldiers essayed to put out the flames, but these efforts were largely ineffective, and the fire raged through the night.  Happily, St. Paul’s Chapel was saved by volunteers bringing buckets of water to drench its roof. <br><br>Very near five hundred homes and buildings have been destroyed.<br><br>Those responsible for the fire are unknown; however, it is no mystery that the Rebels would wish difficulties for the Kings soldiers, who have so recently and valiantly taken hold of the city. An investigation has been begun by General Howe.

!*Liberty! Congress unanimously declares the United Colonies free and independent states!<br><br>Yesterday, the representatives of all thirteen colonies resolved and declared the independence of their citizens and formally dissolved all ties with Britain. This Declaration of Independence, as it is so entitled, was drafted by a committee of authors, principally Thos. Jefferson, John Adams and Benj. Franklin and expresses in language more eloquent than we are able to describe the events and reasoning that have led to this final disruption. <br><br>The Second Constitutional Congress began work on this document months ago, some few among the representatives had every aspiration that the colonies would reconcile with the King and reasonable rights secured. With each additional regiment dispatched to these shores, that hope diminished until all voted in unanimity to severe ourselves from our Mother country.<br><br>John Adams declares that this day should be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of this continent to the other, form this time forward forever more.

!*Continental Army suffers deprivations.<br><br>Encamped a scant twenty miles from Philadelphia, Gen. Washington’s army struggles in harsh winter. After the defeat at Brandywine, the Continental Army suffered humiliation as Congress fled Philadelphia in advance of Royal troops. The Redcoats subsequently marched upon and occupied our patriot capitol. Soon after, miseries were increased with the lamentable defeat at Germantown.<br><br>Gen. Washington has now located his army at a place called Valley Forge south of the Schuylkill River where the high ground of Mounts Joy and Misery provide for easy defense.  However, the Patriots must contend with starvation and want of clothing and shelter. Indeed, the General has set them to the building of huts with logs. He promises twelve dollars to reward the party in each regiment which finishes their hut in the quickest and most workmanlike manner.<br><br>But under several inches of snow, the soldiers are hard pressed to complete their task. The lack of food and clothing has led to outbreak of disease, with many succumbing to dysentery and typhus. Indeed, hundreds have died among the some eleven thousand troops. Only their undiminished loyalty to the cause of independence and to Gen. Washington himself has kept them alive.<br><br>The arrival of military adviser Frederick von Steuben to drill and train the men in correct formations and maneuvers as well as the considerable number of wives and children that have joined the camp and who forage for food and wood have considerably enlivened the general morale.

Washington and his men numbering some eleven thousand men on 28 June. <br><br>The British column was laden with a train of supplies, artillery and Tory citizens from Philadelphia. General Washington discerned an opportunity to attack an ungainly formation and left his encampment at Valley Forge to do so. The Continental Army caught up with the British in the environs of Monmouth. Washington, attempting to disrupt the column and gain time for the bulk of his army to arrive on the scene, gave command of his forward units to Maj. Gen. Charles Lee with orders to attack the column and cut it in half. This paper has learned that Lee was not in accord with the plan and initially refused command. Once he did take command, it appears that no proper orders were given to Lee’s commanders. They proceeded will-he nill-he and soon engaged in undisciplined skirmishes the British rearguard. Perceiving the disarray, Lee ordered a general retreat and was pursued by the Redcoats.<br><br>Lee’s men retreated in confusion directly into Gen. Washington’s advancing column.  We are told that the good General uttered considerable strong oaths, a practice contrary to his nature, and ordered Lee to the rear before setting to rallying Lee’s men himself. The Continentals then engaged Clinton’s forces in full with Lee’s men given to the command of La Marquise de Lafayette.  The American forces, fighting with discipline and order thanks to the efforts of Baron von Steuben, proved a match for their red-coated adversaries. At sundown, the Americans held the field, although Washington wanted to continue the fight.  Darkness saved the British further losses!<br><br>As of this writing, Gen. Chas. Lee is under court-martial in Englishtown. It is expected he will be relieved of his command.

!*As readers of this paper have learned, a French fleet under Adm.  de Grasse had recently sailed from the Caribbean to blockade the English force under Gen. Cornwallis at Yorktown. On Wednesday last, Sept. 5, a British fleet arrived numbering some 19 ships of the line. The French fleet, said to number over twenty, promptly sailed out to engage the British. <br><br>This writer observed from a precipice as the two fleets engaged in the distance.  It was clear that the French were having difficulties maintaining battle order. Their center lagged behind providing a clear opportunity to the British to attack and disrupt them.  But the British Admiral, said to be Adm. Graves, made no such attempt.  A gentlemen nearby made use of a spyglass and exclaimed that the British ships were allowing the French to close line and establish proper formation. Indeed, we all marveled at this. Instead the British rear lagged behind in turn and never engaged on this day. <br><br>The two fleets sailed east, in line against one another, this giving advantage to the French, who could open their hatches and fire from both gun -decks.  The English could not, as the pitched waves would swamp them if their lower-gun deck hatches came open, and thus their 32-pounders could not be brought to action. <br><br>The British took the greater damage, but the battle appeared a stand-off. However, this also favored the French, as their blockade remained intact. This very morning, the French have reinforcements in the person of Adm. de Barras with 7 additional ships of the line.  Reports are that Adm. Graves has set sail and is most probably returning to New York.<br><br>The blockade is thus maintained as infantry and artillery commanded by Gens. Washington and Rochambeau look to besiege Cornwallis.

!*Stunning victory!  Gen. Washington surprises Hessian force at Trenton.<br><br>Hundreds of prisoners taken.<br><br>In a daring raid, Gen. George Washington has in one coup overcome months of reversals and achieved a marked victory. In the teeth of highly difficult conditions, the General was able to assemble some thousands of troops and ford a Delaware River encumbered by floes of ice. In fact, large numbers of his force were unable to complete the crossing, leaving the good General with less than half the troops expected for his raid.  Nonetheless, the Continental Army marched through snow and sleet toward the garrisoned Hessian town of Trenton. Many of the troops were without boots and were therefore forced to tie rags about their feet and to march through the snow thus, leaving dark tracks of blood as a marker to their determination.<br><br>In Trenton, the Americans surprised a Hessian force of 1,500 groggy with sleep.<br><br>The main American force under Washington entered Trenton from the north-west. He sent Gen. Sullivan around the town to attack from the south and set additional forces in a position to the north-east, forestalling a Hessians retreat.  The Hessians made a hasty attempt to form line in the town but were under artillery fire from Capt. Alexander Hamilton as well as attack from front and rear from Washington and Sullivan. Soldiers joined with inhabitants of the town to shoot from house windows upon the Hessian gunners. During this fire-fight, the commander of the garrison, Col. Rall was direly wounded.  His troops retreated to an apple orchard and shortly thereafter surrendered. Nearly nine hundred Hessian troops were taken captive.<br><br>In the fight, Lieutenant James Monroe was wounded, but not grievously.<br><br>Some days before this expedition, Thos. Paine’s pamphlet, The Crisis, was read aloud to these same men.  Mr. Paine begins with the phrase: “These are the times that try men's souls, “and notes that “the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.” <br><br>Col. Rall died from his wounds before the conflict’s end.  A message was found folded in his pocket, warning him of the American approach. A warning he fatally ignored.

!*Benedict Arnold – Loyal to the Crown!<br><br>Surprising his Rebel colleagues, Gen. Benedict Arnold has made a brave attempt to bring an end to continued hostilities.  Having obtained command of the Fort of West Point, Gen Arnold met secretly with Maj. John André, an intelligence officer of the King.  It is difficult to obtain the true nature of the agreement they had in an affair of such emotion, but it appears that they concluded upon a transfer of some funds to Arnold in exchange for West Point itself.  Many have pointed to these funds as evidence that Arnold was interested in coarse gain, yet a man of such valor can hardly be suspected of such motives! Rather, it appears that Arnold was made aware of the pecuniary embarrassment he would suffer once his commission as a Rebel officer was lost, and merely took practical steps to protect himself and his wife from penury. <br><br>Indeed, Gen. Arnold`s wife, Peggy, appears to have played an active part in his loyalist turn. Several reports have surfaced indicating that it was she who first contacted Maj. André as she had known him for some years. <br><br>Sadly for the Crown, the plan unraveled.  After meeting with Arnold, Maj. André cleverly disguised as citizen Mr. John Anderson, was captured by the Rebels. They discovered various papers on him leading to his arrest.    Owing to being dressed as a civilian when captured, this man who took such risks for his King was therefore hanged as a spy.  Rest he in peace.<br><br>Happily, Arnold was warned in time and was able to effect an escape. We are told that he has been awarded a commission in the British Army and we await to hear greater exploits of him in future!

Church’s practice is on Newbury street, a fairly short walk away, so the house was in an ideal location. It’s also in a nice part of town – even in Colonial Boston two-storey houses with fenced-in gardens don’t come cheap, and they didn’t even get cable.<br><br>Actually, given the location it seems that Church’s practice was doing very well indeed. That, or he had another source of revenue.

!*THEATRE ROYAL

Id: [0x00067BB6]
!*You might hear this referred to as “Covent Garden” (which it faces) or the “Royal Opera House” (which it later became). However, this is the original Theatre Royal building – opened in 1732, destroyed by fire in 1808.  It will be rebuilt – then destroyed by fire again in 1857 – and then almost completely renovated in the 1990s. They’ve installed a smoke detector this time.<br><br>The original theatre lineup was varied, containing ballet, operas, even acrobatics. Many of Handel’s operas opened here, right up until his death in 1759, when he mysteriously stopped writing them. But the building was mainly used for presenting plays, at least for the first hundred years of its history. The reason? It held the exclusive rights to perform spoken drama in London – awarded by King Charles II. Yes, kings could do that. Though why they would is beyond me.

!*This lovely little collection of buildings was the headquarters for the original Assassin Order of the Colonies- a modest Masyaf, if you will. Sometime during the Seven Years War the Templars made their move and destroyed it during their Assassin witch hunt. By which I mean there was a witch hunt for Assassins, not that there were Assassin Witches.<br><br>Achilles survived the attack and stuck around to keep the manor standing...barely, by the looks of it. Once Connor came along it flourished again for several decades, even surpassing its former glory. Then it suddenly vanished early in the 19th century.  Any manor that can suddenly vanish is both interesting and unsettling in the same measure, though probably not a great investment.

They eventually moved into this tavern, which was a popular stopping place after training exercises. Militia members were given free beer to encourage them to show up, because freedom fighters are at their sharpest and best after six pints and a packet of nuts.<br><br>Just before dawn the soldiers went back onto the common to meet the British forces. No one knows who fired the first shot, but some accounts say it came from "the corner of a house to the right of the church" - namely, Buckman tavern. Classic pub fight.

!*This was the site of one of the first skirmishes in the Revolutionary War. During the battle at Concord, about 90 British soldiers held this bridge while several hundred rebel militiamen gathered on the hill nearby.  The British were expecting resistance from disorganized farmers, so when the rebels advanced in a “very military manner”, the British panicked. Angry farmers are terrifying at the best of times. Officers gave conflicting orders, the British formations broke and the soldiers ran away. <br><br>The original bridge was torn down in 1788 and a new bridge was built nearby. Of course, it’s been rebuilt several times - the image of the British turning tail is excellent fodder for historical re-enactments, which Americans enjoy re-enacting, but which never seem to be re-enacted on our side of the Atlantic. Strange, that.

The property is more homestead than house - there was a sawmill and a grist mill on the property, and tenant farmers worked the lands.<br><br>The exterior is wood painted to look like stone, which is always a classy look, but the block houses you see on either side are actual stone, meant for defense. When the house was built, the French and Indian war had just ended, so it made sense to have the house ready for an attack. That, or William Johnson made some well-armed enemies in his business dealings.

!*This was George Washington’s headquarters during the winter of 1777. The house was owned by Isaac Potts. It’s a simple country house, in the ever-popular Georgian style.<br><br>The President of Congress wrote that Washington “lives himself in a Hut, that is a little temporary Cabin such as one inhabited by the poorest Boor”, which is exaggeration bordering on slander. Washington lived in a tent for his first week at Valley Forge, but then moved into the Potts house with his entourage. The rest of his soldiers were housed in temporary log cabins built around the valley. <br><br>However, this house isn’t exactly the lap of luxury, either – the rooms are small, and it would have been cramped quarters for the military meetings that took place here – and the twenty-five people who ate, worked, and slept inside. It must’ve been like an 18th century Frat House. It’s said amongst Washington’s greatest achievements was the invention of Beer Pong.<br><br>Anyway, the house is a compromise between Washington’s need to convey the image of a leader, but not place himself too far above the people he leads.

!*GUNPOWDER MAGAZINE

Id: [0x00067BC8]
!*These buildings were used to store gunpowder, which was both a necessity in colonial America, and extremely dangerous to have around. This is not a place you’d want to move next door to. Spilled powder, damaged barrels, improper airing of the building... any one of these was hazardous, and a random spark could set off powder in the air or on the ground. <br><br>People who worked in the magazines were warned to check their pockets for stray matches, or made to wear clothes with no pockets to eliminate the possibility entirely. Their shoes had to be made without nails, or covered with 'magazine slippers' to reduce the risk of sparks. All the tools used in the magazines were made of wood and copper.<br><br>Generally, powder magazines were built in isolated areas (like the one on the Boston Common). Of course, if you're inside a fort you need your gunpowder to be close at hand, so the buildings were designed to collapse in on the fire and smother it, rather than spreading it outward. <br><br>I probably don't need to tell you this, but you’re not really allowed to smoke around here.

!*Printing presses were originally brought to America to print religious texts, but by the time of the Revolutionary War they were also used for things like newspapers, pamphlets, and broadsheets. Think of it as the colonial Internet, about the same speed as dial-up. Unlike word of mouth, newspaper articles could spread news of events from colony to colony quickly, and without any loss of information. <br><br>But that doesn’t mean it was unbiased – far from it. Presses were commonly used to print propaganda. Every newspaper had its slant. Thank goodness that doesn’t happen nowadays. Anyway, part of what made the Boston Massacre such a turning point were reprints of Paul Revere’s woodcut - it showed organized British soldiers in full formation firing point-blank at an innocent crowd. A shocking image, which enraged the people and fuelled their hatred of the British. Completely made-up, of course, but what did that matter? The public is there to be manipulated.<br><br> Actually, I’d bet you could use these places to print some propaganda of your own. If the soldiers are getting too unfriendly, a little reminder that you’re a Hero of the People might help.

!*MARKETS

!*There are a number of public markets in the colonies, meaning you can get supplies easily. Of course, paying for goods is another matter as currency was incredibly complex. People paid in English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese coins, wampum , New Jersey and New York bills, magic beans, Laundromat coins... the list goes on.  We've simplified everything down for you in the Animus. (You're welcome.)<br><br>While some markets sold a variety of goods – like Faneuil Hall in Boston -- others were more specialized. New York’s Coenties Slip was mainly a fish market, (though like most markets it sold a little of everything), while if you were in the market for African slaves, Peck’s Slip was the place to go. <br><br>Yes, slavery was legal at the time, though it was less common in Boston than New York, which had the largest slave population in the north. Don’t be surprised to see European servants for sale, either – some were sold for a fixed number of years to pay back their passage to the New World - a much better deal than the slaves were offered.

Smith was nominally Loyalist, but that didn’t stop him from providing beer to Washington’s army when it was stationed in the town – or to the British Regulars after their arrival. It seems neither army cared about loyalties where beer was concerned. That’s the kind of business attitude that built America. The American dream!

It started out as the Wickquasgeck trail, used by the Indigenous Peoples to cross Manhattan island. It was turned into a street by the Dutch, who called it "BreedeWeg"  -  literally 'Broad Way'.<br><br>In modern day New York the street begins at the Bowling Green and extends across the entire island of Manhattan, through the Financial District and past Times Square and Columbia University.<br><br>Of course, at the time you're visiting, Broadway ends at the city common. The most famous stretch of the street - the Theatre District - is still wilderness, so you’re more likely to catch a bullet there than a show.<br><br>Which in some ways is preferable.

!*BROAD STREET

Id: [0x00067BD2]
!*Broad St. is not Broadway, though you'd be forgiven for some confusion as they're right next to one another. This street was named after the Broad Canal, which used to run down the centre. <br><br>The canal was an inlet from the East River, and for part of its history you could canoe along it. By the late 17th century, however, the water was so clogged that was difficult - and inadvisable. Houses had been built alongside and both residents and local vendors used the canal to dispose of trash and sewage. When the British regained New York in 1674 they made many improvements to the city, one of which was filling in the now-stinking canal and paving the street over it. You can thank me on behalf of all Brits later.<br><br>Nowadays, Broad Street is in the middle of the Financial District, and is mostly home to banks, and another sight you might recognize - the columned façade of the New York Stock Exchange.

!*WALL STREET

Id: [0x00067BD4]
!*In the 17th Century, this marked the edge of the city of New Amsterdam, and it was the location of the city's 12-foot palisade wall. The wall itself was torn down by the British in 1699 but the name "Wall Street" stuck.<br><br>By the late 18th century this was already becoming a financial centre - traders met at the Merchant Coffee House at the corner of Water Street, and under a buttonwood tree outside to trade securities. (This buttonwood tree is the site of the Buttonwood Agreement, which was the beginning of the New York Stock Exchange.)<br><br>The street is only 8 blocks long - as long today as you see it here in the late 1700s. If that seems extremely small remember: the skyscrapers are tall, rather than wide. Otherwise they’d be called Floorhuggers.

!*TRINITY CHURCH

Id: [0x00067BD6]
!*It's unfortunate you're too late to see Trinity Church before it burned (construction on a new church won't start until 1788). Trinity's a bit of an institution in New York, especially in the late 18th century. The church founded both the Trinity School, and King's College, which later became Columbia University. St. Paul's Chapel is another offshoot of the church. (You can't get a better indication of how Loyalist New York was than that: it had two branches of the same Anglican Church operating within blocks of one another.)<br><br>Captain William Kidd (yes, the famous pirate) lent some of his ship's equipment to help build the original church (the one you see here, burned), which was nice of him. Many people these days consider many pirates to have been rather progressive socialists with community-minded consciences, which I rather feel takes away from their mystique. It’s like finding out Genghis Kahn had solar panels.<br><br>Anyway, Kidd had even reserved a pew here, though he left New York before he ever got to sit in it. <br><br>The church building in modern-day New York is the third Trinity building. When it was finished in 1846, it was the tallest building in New York. Of course, it's at the corner of Wall Street, so you can imagine how tall it looks now compared to the local skyscrapers, showing you who really has the influence now.

!*ST. PAUL'S CHAPEL

Id: [0x00067BD8]
!*This chapel opened in 1766 as an extension of Trinity Church, which is slightly farther down Broadway. Unlike Trinity Church, St. Paul's was saved from the Great Fire by local bucket brigades. The original building still stands today, making it one of the oldest churches in Manhattan.<br><br>During the revolution, St. Paul's was known for Loyalist leanings. It's Episcopalian, which is a subset of Anglican, which you'll remember is the 'Church of England'… you can probably guess whose side they were on. Church services specifically prayed for the King and Royal Family, which you can imagine wasn't too popular with the revolutionaries who were occupying the town in 1776. <br><br>After the war ended there was a turnaround in the Church's politics. The rector and some of the more Loyalist congregants left New York, and it became more Patriot-friendly. George Washington attended a service here on his inauguration day, and kept attending while he lived in New York - which probably went a long way toward repairing the church's reputation among the Patriot population.

!*TRINITY SCHOOL

Id: [0x00067BDA]
!*The school opened in 1709 as a 'charity school', meaning it was free to attend and the students would have been from poorer families (at the time, most well-to-do children would have been educated at home). The school was originally in the bell tower of the Trinity Church, but by the time you're seeing it, it's moved across the street.  <br><br>This is the only school that remained open during the British occupation of New York, possibly because it was endowed by Trinity church, which was Loyalist.  (Of course, Trinity also funded King's College, which was closed and used a military hospital, but universities are known liberal hotbeds.)<br><br>After the Revolutionary War, the government started to focus on free public education and the city eventually stopped funding church schools, preferring to fund secular ones. Trinity School became a private preparatory school, which it still is. It's prestigious, expensive, and it's been accepting students for 300 years. That's a long time... for the colonies. Of course, Eton was founded in England in 1440 – that’s 20 years before Ezio was born, and around 50 years before Columbus discovered an America that Etonians would enjoy a proud tradition of looking down on for centuries to come.

It was also the city jail until the New Gaol opened in 1759. <br><br>Despite New York's historically Loyalist leanings, the building has a decidedly rebel-slanted past. Delegates from 9 of the colonies met here to co-ordinate protests against the Stamp Act. That meant representatives from British-instituted legislatures were protesting what British Parliament thought best - a truly huge step at the time.<br><br>After the Constitution was ratified in 1789, Congress began to meet here and the building renamed "Federal Hall". George Washington was inaugurated as president on the balcony on April 30, 1789. Oops, sorry – spoiler alert. Yes, he wins the war and becomes president. And then it turns out he was a ghost all along.<br><br>The building was expanded in 1788, but torn down in 1812. Despite its name, the modern-day "Federal Hall National Memorial" in New York City was never actually Federal Hall.

!*KING'S COLLEGE

Id: [0x00067BDE]
!*King's College first opened on the first floor of the Trinity School in 1754, but it moved to the building that you see here in 1760. <br><br>This building survived the fire in 1776, but it wasn't being used as a school at the time. It had been shut down under the orders of the Continental army and turned into a hospital. It didn’t open again until war ended, when it was given a new name - "Columbia College". Another example of the word "King" falling out of favour among Americans - unless it involves burgers, of course, which just sums you people up.<br><br>The college stayed here until the mid-19th century when it moved to Midtown. The building's cornerstone was moved to the new location, but the rest was torn down and the land underneath it was sold at a tidy profit - which is the history of much of downtown New York.

!*BRIDEWELL PRISON

Id: [0x00067BE0]
!*By 1773, the prison population at the New Gaol was getting so large that the city began plans for a new prison. Bridewell was started in 1773. The building was finished in 1775 but before it saw much use the war happened, and the British started to fill it with American POWs.<br><br>Prison conditions were terrible. Imagine a budget hotel, then take away the budget. There was very little food, most of it bad. There were no window panes - just bars over openings in the walls. One prisoner wrote that in three winter months, the only fire he saw was in the lanterns on the street. This was before our two and a half centuries of global warming, so you can imagine how cold it was.<br><br>When the war ended, this building went back to its intended use -holding local criminals and debtors. I can only hope the new government eventually installed windows and started work on the catering.<br><br>The building was torn down in 1838 and the stones were used to build a new prison that went by the happy nickname of 'The Tombs' – which wasn’t nearly as glamorous as it sounds. It’s been the pet name of every Manhattan jail since.

!*THE NEW GAOL

Id: [0x00067BE2]
!*The "New Gaol" opened in 1759 was the first building in New York to be a dedicated prison - before this criminals were held in the basement of city hall - or in the case of debtors, in the attic, because that’s where I keep all my debtors. <br><br>The building was meant for convicted criminals too, but overwhelming poverty in the neighbourhood around it meant it quickly earned the nickname "the Debtors' Prison". By 1773 it was overcrowded, not just with Debtors but also with prisoners from the French and Indian War. Construction started on a new prison - the Bridewell.<br><br>Both the New Gaol and Bridewell prison were used to house POWs during the British occupation of New York.  It's an understatement to call the conditions there appalling. Hundreds of prisoners were kept with very little food, heat, or adequate clothing (those that did have clothing sold it to get more food.) Diseases like smallpox ran rampant among prisoners. <br><br>The man in charge of the prisons was the Provost Marshal William Cunningham. He was notorious for his cruel treatment of prisoners, and his presence earned the New Gaol yet another nickname - the Provost. His mum must have been so proud.

!*FORT GEORGE

Id: [0x00067BE4]
!*This fort has seen several name changes. It started off in 1625 as Fort Amsterdam - protecting the original Dutch settlement of New Amsterdam. Since then it's been known as Fort James and Fort William, before changing sex to Fort Anne, and swapping back in the 18th century, to Fort George.<br><br>When the Revolutionary War ended Fort George was torn down (perhaps predictably, given that this latest name was in honor of the King). <br><br>Should really have stuck with Fort Anne. Everybody loves an Anne.

!*BOWLING GREEN

Id: [0x00067BE6]
!*This was one of New York's first public parks, established in 1733 by local landlords so people living in the area would have a place to walk, bowl, and get away from the noise of the city. <br><br>Since it's meant as a quiet park, there wouldn't be much more to tell except that a statue of King George III was placed here in 1770, commissioned to celebrate the repeal of the Stamp Act. In 1771, a wrought iron fence was added around the park - possibly to keep malcontents from vandalizing the statue.  <br><br>In 1776, rebels stormed the park, tore down the statue, and hacked it to pieces. The reason for the attack? They'd just heard the Declaration of Independence read publicly for the first time.  Most of the statue was later melted down and turned into musket balls for the Continental Army - perhaps the rebel version of destroying the Liberty Tree for firewood.<br><br>The Bowling Green still exists in modern day New York and it's home to another statue: the "Charging Bull" of Wall Street stands just outside the fence. Different times, different icons.

!*HMS JERSEY

Id: [0x00067BE8]
!*The British took so many prisoners during the Revolutionary War that they quickly ran out of places to put them all. Prisons in New York (like the Bridewell) were full and the British took to using sugar houses, and pro-rebel churches in the city.<br><br>In the harbour, decommissioned war ships were put to use as prison ships, the most well-known being the HMS Jersey.  The Jersey had - and earned - the nickname 'Hell'. I wonder if you can guess why. Conditions below decks (where the prisoners were kept) were crowded - a thousand men crammed together without light, sanitation, or proper ventilation.  <br><br>About a dozen prisoners died every day - from smallpox, yellow fever, malnutrition, and torture by the guards.  I'm not even going to begin describing the food; well, alright, I’ll begin… "inedible" and "worm-infested". But I won’t finish.<br><br>The British sentiment was the rebels were traitors and didn't deserve any better.<br><br>At least 11000 people died on board the prison ships - more than rest of the war put together. After the British left New York, the US Navy found mass graves in the mud at the edge of the harbour. Those remains have since been placed under a monument in Brooklyn, where Fort Putnam used to be.

!*OLD ROYAL EXCHANGE

Id: [0x00067BEA]
!*This was the first covered market in New York. It started as a one-story building in 1675, but it was replaced with the building you see here in 1752. The lowest floor is for the market, and the second floor contains rooms that could be used for concerts, public meetings and balls.<br><br>Balls as in dances. Not just a big room full of balls.<br><br>It's no accident that this building bears a resemblance to Faneuil Hall in Boston. It was common architecture for markets at the time. Private houses didn't have the space for large numbers of people, so these buildings combined open space for a market, with closed-in space for the upper crust to have fancy parties.<br><br>Of course, public rooms could be used by the rabble as well. The Sons of Liberty brought crowds here, notably to choose delegates for the Second Continental Congress. (Technically, that was the New York Assembly's job, but they'd refused to send anyone.)<br><br>After the Revolutionary War ended, this building was the first home of the Supreme Court. Its first session began on February 2, 1790. It didn't stay here for long however, and moved to Philadelphia in 1791.

!*INDEPENDENCE HALL

Id: [0x00067BEC]
!*This was built between the 1730s and 1750s to be the Pennsylvania State House. The architecture is Georgian, which was popular at the time, and essentially means the building was made to look similar to English manor houses of its day - 'Georgian', of course, being a reference to King George.<br><br>Some of the most important documents in the American Revolution came out of this building. The Declaration of Independence was first debated and signed here. The United Constitution was drafted here.  And if that weren't enough, the Liberty Bell rang in the bell tower to summon people to meetings (before it cracked beyond repair, of course, and also before it was really known as the Liberty Bell, but we won’t let that get in the way of a good story).<br><br>The building became known as Independence Hall in the 1820s - a result of the Marquis de Lafayette making a return trip to the United States. Lafayette’s visit was meant to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the revolution – and to remind a new generation what had happened, and where. It worked – creating a sense of national history, and an obsession with tagging things with the words 'Liberty', 'Independence', 'Freedom' and 'Washington'.

!*BUNKER HILL

Id: [0x0006B82E]
!*This is the largest hill on the Charlestown peninsula, and the closest to the mainland. <br><br>During the Battle of Bunker Hill rebel reinforcements arriving on the Charlestown peninsula headed to Bunker Hill, but weren't sure what to do once they got there. Rather than joining the battle- which was raging on Breed's Hill, nearby - they wandered aimlessly around Bunker Hill, so disorganized they hadn’t even brought a picnic.<br><br>Israel Putnam was here attempting to direct troops - giving valuable instructions such as the famous "Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes" (Which he probably said several times, to anyone who'd listen, and to be fair, it’s a pretty great quote). That seems to be the only one of his directions that stuck - many of his other orders were either misunderstood or deliberately disobeyed. Given the disorganized state of the Continental Army at the time, it was probably a little of both.

Id: [0x0006B82F]
!*BREED'S HILL

Id: [0x0006B830]
!*Technically the Battle of Bunker Hill could have been called the "Battle of Breed's Hill". This is where the Continental Army built their main fortifications, and so most of the fighting happened here.  <br><br>Breed's Hill had only one thing to recommend it over Bunker Hill – it was closer to Boston, which made it easier to fire artillery at the city. Though of course one disadvantage of this situation was that it was also a lot easier for Boston to fire back. Nobody knows why William Prescott chose the spot over Bunker Hill - it's possible that, since he was working on fortifications in the dark, Prescott didn't realize how vulnerable the hill actually was until the sun rose. By which point it was a little too late to up and move. I imagine that was probably quite an awkward moment.

!*MOULTON'S HILL

Id: [0x0006B832]
!*The lowest hill on the Charlestown Peninsula, standing at 32 feet, or about 10 metres high, it is sometimes referred to as Moulton Hill or Moulton’s Point.<br><br>This is where General Howe's troops landed during the Battle of Bunker Hill. Boston's actually on the opposite side of the peninsula, but Howe took the longer route round to outflank the Revolutionaries on their left side. That was his excuse for taking the long route, anyway, and he was sticking to it.<br><br>However, Howe made a mistake when he arrived: he saw Continental troops on Bunker Hill and assumed they were newly-arrived reinforcements (they were mostly just confused and milling around, like aimless youths outside a shopping mall). Howe halted to wait for his own reinforcements, which gave the Continental Army time to shore up weak spots in their defenses. This made the battle much longer and more difficult than it might have been.<br><br>It also means there was an advantage to the chaos in the Continental Army that day - they managed to confuse their enemies as well as themselves. It’s not a bad tactic. To this day, if anyone starts on me, I just spin around and shout about tables until they’re too confused and amble off.

!*CHARLESTOWN

Id: [0x0006B834]
!*Charlestown is the name of both the small town to the north of Boston, and the peninsula it sits on.  <br><br>The peninsula was the site of the Battle of Bunker Hill (which was sometimes called the 'Battle of Charlestown', since the fighting did span across more than one hill). This is also where Paul Revere started his well-known Midnight Ride, which I still think sounds more like something you’d do with a lady.<br><br>As to the town of Charlestown - well, while it was established prior to 1775, little of it survived the Battle of Bunker Hill. Continental Army snipers were stationed here to harass British troops, and the British set fire to the town to root them out. Most of the buildings were razed, and the rest was burned during a raid in January, 1776. The only part of the town to survive the war was the street layout. <br><br>Charlestown was rebuilt, however - it's now a part of Boston.

!*CHESAPEAKE BAY

Id: [0x0006B836]
!*The Chesapeake Bay runs along the coast of Virginia and Maryland. It's one of the largest bays in the United States - more than 300 kilometres long and up to 40 kilometres wide - and the site of the first permanent British settlement in North America - Jamestown, established in 1607. <br><br>Every day at 16:07 I have a cup of tea and think of it.<br><br>It's also the site of the Battle of the Chesapeake, one of the most important naval battles of the Revolutionary war.

!*LEXINGTON

Id: [0x0006B838]
!*Lexington is a small farming community, and the site of the first battle of the American Revolution started. No, I'm not being overly dramatic – the first battle took place on Lexington green.<br><br>On the morning of April 19, 1775, British Regulars passed through Lexington on their way to Concord looking for hidden rebel weapon caches.<br><br>The Lexington militia, led by John Parker, formed up on the village green -probably more in a show of resistance than because they were expecting a real battle. The militia was badly outnumbered – about 70 of them to 700 British soldiers. John Pitcairn ordered the rebels to disperse, and they might have done so… except somebody fired a shot. Then, everyone started firing – those that weren't running, that is.<br><br>Several militia members were killed, the rest retreated. The British moved on toward Concord – though they would be harassed by the Lexington militia again on their return trip toward Boston.<br><br>Lexington's town motto is now "What a Glorious Morning for America" – though it's possible it didn't seem like one at the time. “Firing Guns and Then Running Away, Since 1775!” might have been a nice alternative. Every town needs a bumper sticker.

!*CONCORD

Id: [0x0006B83A]
!*This was the Regulars' destination when they set out from Boston on the day of the battles of Lexington and Concord. Inside the town, the British found cannon, flour, salt food, and musket balls. They broke the cannon and threw the rest into the local mill pond – a bad idea since the local residents retrieved most of it later, undamaged. <br><br>In their zeal the regulars also accidentally set fire to the local meeting house – (it happens) - and then joined the bucket brigade to help put it out. However, the local militia saw the smoke and thought the Regulars had set fire to the whole town. The militia marched in, causing a battle with the Regulars at the North Bridge, just outside of town. It was a comedy of errors with very little comedy.<br><br>The battle at the North Bridge battle was immortalized in the "Concord Hymn" - a popular poem by Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emerson lived in Concord in the 1830s, which probably made him a bit biased. He refers to the fighting at the bridge as "the shot heard 'round the world" – bit of an overstatement, since the first shots of the war had been fired at Lexington, hours before. Maybe he’d been napping. You know what poets are like.

!*FORT DUQUESNE

Id: [0x0006B83C]
!*This fort sits at the junction of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers - essentially the beginning of the Ohio River. In 1754, the French and British governments were fighting over who controlled the territory in the area. When settlers from Virginia began to build a fort, French Canadian forces chased them out, which is weird, because Canadians are usually so polite. Anyway, they finished the fort, which was nice of them, and named it after the then-governor of New France, the Marquis Duquesne, which was wonderfully thoughtful.<br><br>In response, the British colonial government sent George Washington to re-take the fort (at the Battle of Fort Necessity), and then Edward Braddock (the Braddock Expedition). Both attempts failed miserably, each being defeated before they ever reached the fort. <br><br>Fort Duquesne remained under French control until 1758, when the French troops abandoned and burned it. The British moved in and rebuilt it, naming the new construction 'Fort Pitt' - the location of modern-day Pittsburgh, which makes me think maybe they shouldn’t have bothered.

!*HANCOCK-CLARKE HOUSE

Id: [0x0006B83E]
!*John Hancock's grandfather (the Reverend John Hancock) had this parsonage built in 1737. The "Clarke" in the name is Reverend Jonas Clarke, who lived here at the time the Revolution started. I’d have just called it Hanclarke House, myself, but that’s just because I’m a great thinker.<br><br>John Hancock (the famous politician, not his grandfather) and Samuel Adams were staying here as Clarke's guests the night before the Battles of Lexington and Concord. William Dawes and Paul Revere arrived sometime after midnight with a warning that the Regulars were on their way. Adams and Hancock moved to a safer location – Hancock, it seems, under protest, since he wanted to go down to the Green and fight. <br><br>Men who want to down to greens and fight at midnight are of course dedicated men of passion. <br><br>That, or they’ve had a few beers.

!*KANIÈN:KEH NATION TERRITORY

Id: [0x0006B840]
!*More commonly known these days as the "Mohawk Valley", this valley follows the Mohawk River as it runs between the Catskill and Adirondack mountains. It is part of the territory of the Kanien'kehà:ka - sometimes known as the "Mohawk" in English, hence the name. <br><br>The valley also happens to be the only natural route from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes - meaning it was the only easy way to get from the coast into frontier territory, and up into Canada. This made the valley incredibly strategically important during the French and Indian War and during the Revolutionary war. <br><br>And by 'strategically important' I mean the valley was contested territory and regularly raided. Most of the settlements in it were razed during the Revolutionary War - actually, the damage to the surrounding farmland was so bad that food had to be shipped into the area from the south. The Revolution is known in the area as "The Burning of the Valleys" - that says it all, really.

!*BOSTON NECK

Id: [0x0006B842]
!*In the 18th century, the only land route into Boston was across a narrow strip of land - called "Boston Neck". <br><br>One often talks about the heart of Africa, of course, or the bosom of Europe. How wonderful that Boston gets a neck.<br><br>Fortifications were built across the neck to protect the city from a land attack, I suppose a bit like a heavy necklace, or a handsome neck brace.<br><br>When the Siege of Boston began in 1775, Governor Gage ordered that the fortifications be expanded and strengthened - they became known as "Gage's Lines".<br><br>Starting in the 19th century, land was added to Boston Neck,  widening it to make room for the city to grow - and, presumably, to ease traffic on and off the island, since Boston's no longer in danger of attack from the countryside.

!*BATTLE OF FORT NECESSITY

Id: [0x0006B844]
!*This was one of the opening battles of the French and Indian war, and it’s important that opening battles are quite exciting, otherwise everyone just sort of loses interest.<br><br>In 1754, George Washington was sent to the head of the Ohio River valley with a group of Virginia militia. The land there was contested territory between the British Colonists and the French. Washington's mission was to re-take Fort Duquesne, and drive French forces out of the area.<br><br>Washington and his troops attacked a French patrol at Jumonville Glen, in what would be the first acts of violence in the war. Washington expected a return attack and so had his troops build a palisade wall surrounding their supplies - a "Fort of Necessity" - hence the name.<br><br>But they might as well have called it the “Fort of Inadequacy”, because supplies ran low, and the militia (and their British Regular reinforcements) were quickly overwhelmed. On July 4, Washington surrendered, was allowed to retreat, and someone else was put in charge of naming forts. <br><br>It was Washington’s only military surrender (though he had plenty of 'strategic retreats’ – PR spin was alive and well even then…).

Id: [0x0006B845]
!*BATTLE OF NASSAU

Id: [0x0006B846]
!*The Battle of Nassau was one of the first fought by the Continental Navy. <br><br>The town of Nassau sits on the island of New Providence in the Caribbean Sea. At the beginning of the Revolutionary war, the island was controlled by the British and a destination for Loyalists fleeing the American colonies. It was also a destination for any stores the British didn't want the Continental Army to have - such as gunpowder. <br><br>As soon as the revolution broke out, The (British) Governor of Virginia moved the colony's weapon stores here so the rebels couldn't steal them. Of course, as soon as Washington had the Navy up and running, one of their first missions was to go and reclaim the gunpowder. They loved the stuff – couldn’t get enough of it.<br><br>The Continental Navy attacked Fort Montagu, at the entrance to the harbour, on March 3. Plans to capture the town at the same time fell through, and so the army didn't capture Nassau itself until the next day. The delay meant that most of the gunpowder was gone by the time the rebels arrived, very much the military equivalent of showing up late to a party and realising all the beer’s gone.  The governor had shipped it off during the night - when the Continental Navy had neglected to put even one ship on guard in the harbour. <br><br>The rebels spent the next two weeks loading any of the munitions that were left onto ships before sailing back to Connecticut. Two weeks seems like a long time - perhaps they were checking the beaches very thoroughly, just in case there were cannon hidden in the sand.

!*COPP'S HILL BATTERY

Id: [0x0006B848]
!*Copp's Hill is one of the tallest hills in Boston and the highest point in Boston's North End. The hill was fortified during the Siege of Boston, partly to discourage rebels from building their own fortifications across the river on the Charlestown peninsula. <br><br>The artillery on Copp's Hill fired on the Continental Army during the Battle of Bunker Hill… well, sort of. It was actually a bit more distraction than destruction - at least at the Breed's Hill fortifications. The artillery fire on the town of Charlestown was more effective - the resulting fires forced out Continental Army snipers and levelled the town.

Id: [0x0006B849]
!*NORTH BATTERY

Id: [0x0006B84A]
!*The North Battery was one of the first fortifications built in Boston after the city was founded. Since Boston was mostly accessible by water, it was vulnerable to attack from the French and Dutch. The residents of Boston's North End had the battery built in the mid-17th century to protect the harbour. It was never actually used, but somehow having a military fort nearby just made people feel safer - much like American airport security, but with uniforms that actually fit them, and less dandruff and passive aggression.

!*FORT HILL AND SOUTH BATTERY

Id: [0x0006B84C]
!*Fort Hill is the second-highest hill in Boston – if only it had tried harder when it was a little hillock - and overlooks Boston Harbour. Defenses were built here in the mid-17th century - along with a smaller one-gun fortification near the harbour - named the South Battery.<br><br>The South battery was expanded in the 1740s, but had fallen out of use by the 1760s. Both it and Fort Hill were rebuilt by the Patriots during the Revolutionary War, but both were dismantled before the turn of the century.<br><br>Fort Hill - the hill itself, not the fortification - was levelled in the late 1860s to make room for more land, so it never realized its dream of becoming the highest hill in town. If that sounds familiar, it's because it happened to every hill in Boston. <br><br>Hills are the natural enemies of Bostonians, and always will be.

!*TRADING POSTS

Id: [0x0006B84E]
!*Trading Posts were essentially general stores set up in the North American frontier. The clientele - mainly explorers and members of local Indigenous nations - would barter for various goods, such as guns, axes, and pots and pans. Payment was mostly in the form of furs, which were shipped back to Europe. The fur trade at the time was extremely lucrative, and one of the reasons that explorers were continually moving into the frontier - they were hoping to find more and better sources of pelts. There was a reason Davy Crockett only ever seemed to have one hat.<br><br>Many of the trading posts were privately owned, but they were used to push political agendas as well. For example, after the Revolutionary War ended, the British government used their trading posts to encourage the Indigenous Peoples not to sign treaties with the United States.<br><br>The United States government took over the colonial fur trade in the colonies in 1796, establishing something called the "Factory" system. The idea was to regulate prices in order stop exploitation of the Indigenous Peoples by private traders. Unfortunately, under the new system, Indigenous leaders were forced to trade large amounts of land to get access to trading posts. Private exploitation had become government exploitation. Lucky that’s the only time in history that’s ever happened. Since that obviously wasn't any better, the factory system was abolished in 1822.

!*MARTINIQUE

Id: [0x0006B850]
!*Martinique is an island in the Caribbean Sea. At the time of the Revolutionary War, it was a French colony, and a lucrative port in the sugar trade. The British captured Martinique during the Seven Years' War. However, it was so profitable for the French that they signed over almost all their Canadian territory at the end of the war, simply to get it back. <br><br>Hmm… a beautiful, lucrative island in the Caribbean – or some tinpot, arse-freezing Nova Scotian backwater…<br><br>It’s just so TRICKY, I need more time!

!*FORT WOLCOTT

Id: [0x0006B852]
!*Fort Wolcott was built to protect the nearby town of Newport, Rhode Island. The fort sits in Newport harbour on a small island known as "Goat Island".<br><br>I know almost no one who would want to live in a place called Goat Island. <br><br>Apart from one goat I know.<br><br>The original fort was built in the early 1700s by the Spanish. It was expanded by the British in the 1730s, which is when it was named Fort George (after King George II, of course).  The fort was captured by Rhode Islanders twice in the 1760s and used to fire on British ships in the harbour. At the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, the rebels renamed it Fort Liberty. It was retaken by the British in November In 1776 – who decided Fort Liberty wasn’t really appropriate any more and returned its name to Fort George.<br><br>It remained Fort George until about 1784, when it was again occupied by rebel forces and renamed Fort Washington. It was later renamed Fort Wolcott - after Oliver Wolcott.<br><br>I know what you're thinking, and it's true: this fort has changed names more times than your high school band.

!*Not exactly a first date venue, this.<br><br>Dead Chest Island is part of the British Virgin Islands, though it's an island in the same way that Pluto is a planet - It's really more of a big rock.<br><br>However, I won't deny the place has an interesting name - and an interesting history. According to legend, Edward Teach - better known as Blackbeard - visited the "island", and left 15 of his crewmen here as a punishment.  Each crewman each had a bottle of rum and cutlass - and when Blackbeard returned, most of the men were dead. Maybe the rum was bad. <br><br>Robert Louis Stevenson wrote a song about that story - you may have heard of it - "Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum/ 15 men on a Dead Man's Chest". Of course, Stevenson wrote "Dead Man's Chest" and the island's name is "Dead Chest", but that’s the rhythm of poetry for you, and I think the link is fairly clear.

!*OCTAVIUS

Id: [0x0006B856]
!*This ship is actually the center of a ghost story that most historians would tell you is complete bunk. Unlike all other ghost stories, of course. And yet, here we are.<br><br>According to legend, the Octavius was captained by Hendrick van der Huel, who once served as quartermaster for Captain William Kidd.  In 1761, the ship left England, on its way to Asia. The captain and crew made the dangerous passage around Cape Horn, and a year later, the ship was completely stocked and ready to return to Europe.<br><br>No one knows why van der Huel decided to return home through the Northwest Passage. At the time no one had ever even found a sea route through the North - making this decision akin to suicide. Unsurprisingly, the ship disappeared en route - presumably sunk, or locked in the ice.<br><br>That's when things get really interesting. Sometime in the 1770s, the crew of a whaling ship found the Octavius floating off the coast of Greenland. The crew inside had all frozen to death - including the captain, who was frozen in the process of writing a log entry - dated to 1762. That means the crew of the Octavius died, and sometime in the intervening years the ship made the Northwest Passage - by itself.<br><br>Yup. Definitely ghosts.

!*OAK ISLAND

Id: [0x0006B858]
!*Oak Island is in Mahone Bay on the eastern shore of Canada.  The island features prominently in local pirate legends - it seems the 'secret' treasure Kidd buried here didn't remain as secret as he would have liked, which of course was very secret, hence the word ‘secret’.<br><br>Treasure hunts first began in 1795, a local teenager spotted a tree with rope burns and a nearby depression in the ground - which he thought was a sure sign that something had been lowered into a pit.  He and some friends started to dig, but quickly got beyond their depth and resolved to come back with better tools. Subsequent digs have happened in 1803, 1861, 1866, 1893, 1909, 1931… well, you get the idea - but nothing's ever been found. Six people have died hunting for the supposed treasure.<br><br>Over the years, theories about the origin of the 'Money Pit' have been abundant: it's nothing more than a sinkhole; treasure was left in the pit - either by William Kidd, or the Freemasons, or the Templars. <br><br>Here's my personal favourite - Francis Bacon used the pit to store the original documents proving that he wrote the works of William Shakespeare. I'm almost sorry that one isn't true.<br><br>Or is it…?<br><br>No. It’s not.

!*EDINBURGH CASTLE, JAMAICA

Id: [0x0006B85A]
!*Not to be confused with the rather more famous Edinburgh Castle in Scotland - this "Edinburgh Castle" is more of a stone manor house. The building has a castle-like appearance, with its two circular towers, useful for shooting at enemies - or, if you were the owner - random travellers who happened by.<br><br>Lewis Hutchinson was a doctor from Scotland who bought the land here in 1768. By 1770, he'd earned the nicknames "The Mad Master" and "The Mad Doctor".  See if you can spot the word that links those two nicknames. Nobody local went near Edinburgh Castle if they could help it.  But the main road in the area went right by the manor house, meaning many travellers walked directly into Hutchinson's path. <br><br>Hutchinson would shoot his victims from one of the towers, take their valuables, and have his slaves toss the body into a nearby sinkhole. If someone happened to stop and ask for hospitality, he would invite them in … and they would never leave. <br><br>Hutchinson was arrested in 1773 for murder, and subsequently hanged. Nobody knows how many people he killed in his 5 years at the castle, but after his execution, a collection of 43 watches was found inside. <br><br>So at least 43, I’d say.

!*The Mayan city of Cerros sits on a hilltop overlooking Chetumal  Bay. In the late 17th century, this is Spanish territory, though it will become part of the British Honduras, and eventually the independent nation of Belize.<br><br>Of course, Cerros itself predates all that - it was founded sometime around 350 BC, when it was an important trading center for ships travelling up the coast. In its heyday, about 1100 people lived there. <br><br>That may not seem like a lot - but the stonework in the area shows the city's prominence. The architecture features stepped pyramids, stone carvings, temples, and get this - two ball courts. Now, we're not clear on the rules, but from the location of the courts it seems the game was important - and deadly. Murals at other similar sites show the winners beheading their opponents. Maybe that was their version of trash talking the other team. Or maybe not…<br><br>And I thought Americans took their 'football' seriously.

!*ATLANTIC OCEAN

Id: [0x0006B85E]
!*Of course, crossing the Atlantic today is as easy as a plane ride, but it was much more difficult in colonial times – even though I imagine the tiny food and cramped conditions and likelihood of sitting next to a fat man for many hours were pretty much the same. <br><br>For European travellers it was at best a six-week voyage - but depending on delays it could last months. Dangers included storms (and their opposite, being becalmed) seasickness, food running short and dying of boredom because you had nothing to do all day. <br><br>For Africans captured into slavery, the Atlantic voyage was much worse - across the "middle passage", usually to the Caribbean. The journey was just as long, but slaves were kept below decks and rarely allowed out in the fresh air - with the men usually in shackles. They were given only one meal a day - less if provisions ran low. Disease was rampant, and mortality rates were high.  <br><br>I will never complain about being inappropriately touched by airport security again. Though to be fair, we’re now firm friends, and Juan was very gentle.

!*CARIBBEAN SEA

Id: [0x0006B860]
!*The Caribbean Sea sits between the coast of Central and South America on one side, and the West Indies on the other. The name 'Caribbean' is taken from 'Carib', the name of the indigenous peoples living on the islands when Columbus 'discovered' them in 1492. <br><br>In Colonial times, European powers relied on the Caribbean islands for crops, such as sugar and coffee beans, which were in high demand. Maybe that’s where the ‘bean’ bit comes from, though I doubt it. In fact, the value of trade in the Caribbean was one of the big reasons that the Continental Army needed a navy of its own - they needed to be able to disrupt trade there in order to make the Revolutionary War a bigger pain in Britain's pocketbook.

Id: [0x0006B87C]
!*Around 1000 years ago, a long and bloody war engulfed the five indigenous nations that inhabited what is now known as central New York State, southern Ontario, southern Quebec, and western Vermont.   In the west were the Seneca and Cayuga nations.  To the east were the Kanien’kehá:ka and Oneida nations.  Located in the center of this territory was the Onondaga Nation.<br><br>In the midst of this war, a messenger known as the Peacemaker provided a path of peace, righteousness, and power that unified these nations and put an end to their bloody war.  This union or alliance is called the Haudenosaunee, a western Iroquoian term that is generally translated as People of the Longhouse.  The Kanien’kehá:ka term is Rotinonhsón:ni, which means “they are building an extended house.”  In 1722, the Tuscarora Nation was adopted into the Haudenosaunee, becoming the sixth nation of the confederation. <br><br>The foundation of Haudenosaunee Confederacy is the Kaianere’kó:wa – the Great Law of Peace.  This ancient doctrine provides an elaborate and efficient institution of democratic governance, social and economic stability, and a moral equation to achieve a personal and collective peace.<br> <br>The Haudenosaunee Confederacy is a constitutional democracy that is governed by a group of 50 Chiefs, who make decisions through a complex consensus-building process.<br><br>In colonial times, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy held a prevalent political and military influence over the Eastern Woodlands of North America.

Each of the 50 Chiefs installed on the council is named after one of the original founders of the League when it was established.<br><br>During debates of the Haudenosaunee Grand Council, the leadership are divided into three deliberating parties.  The first party is made up of both Seneca and Mohawk Chiefs.   The second party is made up of both Oneida and Cayuga Chiefs (including the Tuscarora Chiefs).  The third party is made up of Onondaga Chiefs, called the Firekeepers.<br><br>As the facilitators of the council, the Seneca and Mohawk Chiefs present the standing issue to the Chiefs of the Oneida and Cayuga nations (including the Tuscarora Nation).  Following a discussion amongst themselves, the Oneida and Cayuga Chiefs shall formulate a resolution to the standing issue and return it to the Seneca and Mohawk Chiefs for their consideration.  <br><br>The two parties shall then deliberate upon the standing issue back and forth in this manner until they achieve a consensus.  Once both the Seneca/Mohawk Chiefs and the Oneida/Cayuga Chiefs come to one mind, the standing issue is then passed along to the Onondaga Chiefs, who shall either confirm the resolution or offer a counterproposal.

The Kanien’kehá:ka have three clans – the Turtle Clan, Wolf Clan, and Bear Clan.  Family names and clans are passed down from mother to child.  <br><br>Each member of a clan is considered a relative regardless of which Haudenosaunee nation they belong to.  For example, a Wolf Clan member of the Kanien’kehá:ka Nation and a Wolf Clan member of the Seneca Nation are still considered relatives.    Likewise, the men and women of the Kanien’kehá:ka Nation practiced exogamy, marrying outside their matrilineal clan family.  <br><br>Clans have specific social, spiritual, and political roles to play in Kanien’kehá:ka society and is the pillar of traditional Kanien’kehá:ka governance.  Within the clans of the Kanien’kehá:ka all leadership members hold equal powers and are accountable to everyone.  A woman leader, called Iakoiá:ner or Clanmother, holds a powerful leadership role in the nation and has the authority to select a Roiá:ner or Chief to represent her clan politically.  Moreover, she also has the power to depose her Chief and replace him with another candidate.  Taking into account all she knows about the candidate in his dealings throughout his life she decides who is a good fit to represent the clan.  Clanmothers choose men who are honest, reliable, and clear headed, with knowledge of Kaianere’kó:wa –  the Great Law of Peace.<br><br>Amongst the Haudenosaunee nations there are eight clans: Turtle, Wolf, Beaver, Hawk, Eel, Deer, Bear, and Snipe clans.   The Kanien’kehá:ka themselves have three clans: Turtle, Wolf, and Bear.

Id: [0x0006B896]
!*In the times before European contact and up until the early 1800’s, longhouses originally served as the living quarters of Iroquoian people.  Stretching between 40 and 200 feet long, longhouses were long rectangular structures that housed a number of families belonging to a particular matrilineal clan family. Along the inner walls were open compartments for each nuclear family with a long courtyard in the center, which connected the two entrances on each end of the building.  Two adjacent families would share one fire hearth at each compartmental increment.<br><br>When the Peacemaker brought the Good Tidings of Peace and Power to the Iroquois, he used the concept of the Longhouse as the symbol of the political and spiritual union of the Iroquois Confederacy.  The Kaianere’kó:wa, the Great Law of Peace, identifies specific geographically appropriate household roles for each of the Five Nations sheltered beneath the dormers of the symbolic Longhouse.  <br><br>The Mohawks serve as the Keepers of the Eastern Door, the Senecas as Keepers of the Western Door, and the centrally placed Onondagas serve as the Firekeepers; where all Confederate business is transacted.  Each nation had its own hearth which symbolized its own domestic government, while the rafters symbolized the laws of the League; that continues to extend with every resolution of the Grand Council of Chiefs.

Id: [0x0006C3CA]
!*One of the issues surrounding the American Revolution was that the colonies had no representatives - and thus no say - in British Parliament. <br><br>To add insult to injury, some parts of the United Kingdom that had no actual residents DID have seats in Parliament. This essentially meant landowners could give the cushy government appointments to whomever they wanted. These areas were known as "pocket boroughs" (because the landowner had them in his pocket) or "rotten boroughs" (a fun game is to guess why). <br><br>One of the worst examples was the borough of Old Sarum, which had no voters and two seats in Parliament. However, it wasn't the only one. Pocket boroughs were numerous - as of 1761 it's estimated that 250 of the 558 parliamentary boroughs were under this kind of patronage - and the problem wasn't really corrected until the late 19th century. <br><br>So when the Colonists were complaining that the British Government was hopelessly corrupt? They had a point.

Id: [0x0006CB02]

Id: [0x0006CB1B]

Id: [0x0006CB1C]
!*After finding out Charles Lee was seeing to the gathering of all New Hampshire munitions and returning it all to where it came from, New Hampshire is free of Templar grasp, for now. Return there periodically and maintain a watchful eye.

!*Some British schooners have been prowling off the coast of Gloucester. Take First Mate Faulkner of the Aquila and pin them in allowing the Patriots in the area to capture the war ships.

Id: [0x0006CB25]
!*Gun powder is in short supply for the Patriot cause, despite the militias best efforts to seize as much as possible. Some French ships are delivering several thousand barrels over the next few weeks. Accompany the convoys and ensure they arrive at their destinations safely.

Id: [0x0006CB26]
!*Henry Knox is attempting to drag the guns of Ticonderoga over the Appalachian mountains to help lift the Siege of Boston. With a little Assassin ingenuity you'll be able to help him succeed in his lofty goals.

Id: [0x0006CB27]
!*The British are laying siege to Boston. Civilians are in danger all over the city and food will be in short supply before long. Help ration what there is and protect those who can't protect themselves.

Id: [0x0006CB28]
!*Henry Knox managed to bring the guns of Ticonderoga to Dorchester Heights with the help of the Assassins. With a formidable battery in place on high ground, it's only a matter of time before General Howe realizes his position is untenable. Help expedite the process.

Id: [0x0006CB31]
!*After difficulties with the French Fleet during the Battle at Rhode Island, General Sullivan has sent a scathing letter to Boston reporting on the French involvement, or lack thereof. Catch up with Admiral Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing, and convince him to be the bigger man. The Patriots can't afford to lose the support of France.

Id: [0x0006CB3E]
!*Lieutenant General Sir Henry Clinton of the Regulars is trying to draw General Washington into open conflict. Washington knows such a maneuver would spell certain doom for his tenuous army and is relying on the efforts of his Culper Ring to keep his movements secret. Meet some of the Culper Ring spies in New Haven and escort them to West Point.

That turned out to be very handy for the Colonists, because you needed lumber for pretty much everything - from ships to buildings to furniture; or simply to heat your home in the winter.<br><br>Lumbering developed into a trade fairly quickly. It was both a dangerous and low-paying job that generated tough, hard-working folks; it's now somewhat symbolic of the hardship settlers had to face establishing themselves in North America.

!*To say that farming was a difficult occupation in Colonial America would be an understatement. Farmers had to clear their lot of rocks and trees before working the soil in the hope that it would yield effective results. It could take years before a farm would become fully sustainable. Apart from a few visits to nearby settlements to trade equipment and supplies or sell whatever was in surplus from their crops, farmers would often remain on their land their whole life. <br><br>Farmers had to be autonomous. They had to take care of their home, farming equipment, livestock, as well as procuring the necessary supplies to sustain living in sometimes harsh conditions, especially in northern regions.<br><br>So if you enjoy backbreaking work in a lonely atmosphere, this would be the job for you. (And if that was their slogan, they needed a better marketing department.)

Id: [0x0006CBD3]
!*Benjamin Franklin once said that “North America has no mines”. Which was rather silly of him, because it actually did. However, I'm telling you this to show you that there weren't very MANY mines. The cost of transport and the vast distances over which mined ore had to be carried discouraged anyone but the most enterprising (and given the amount of work the average Colonist had to do from day-to-day, you'd frankly have to be very enterprising or very desperate.)  <br><br>However, during the Revolutionary War, imports of metal were scarce - and sort of necessary for basic tools (like guns), so mining as an industry picked up. Most mines were used to dig copper and iron. Miners worked in extremely difficult conditions, often under the threat of raids from the local Indigenous peoples. They were usually low-wage foreign workers with few other employment options. So, desperate then.

Id: [0x0006CBD4]
!*Hunting in colonial America represented a significant point of contact between settlers and Native Americans and was a fundamental part of both colonial and Native culture.<br><br>Hunting was both lucrative and the primary way to procure food in isolated areas. Hunters would roam the vast expanses of the frontier, tracking and hunting game that would in turn yield good profits (at least, if they didn't try to cheat you out of them at the local trading post, which I'm sure never happened.). In fact, the fur trade was one of the main reasons that European settlement of the frontier moved so quickly - pelts were in high demand in England and France.

Id: [0x0006CBD5]
!*The woodworker is second only to the blacksmith in terms of importance for the healthy development of colonial settlements. Carpenters and joiners were needed everywhere, from house building to furniture production. Using a variety of tools, they would develop fairly sophisticated techniques -  chiseled mortises (which sounds very fancy but is actually a way of joining two pieces of wood), carved moldings (which actually are fancy) and complicated staircases, providing settlers with sturdy and durable, if somewhat roughly finished wood items.<br><br>Of course, nowadays you'd probably be charged extra for the half-finished, "authentic" colonial look. The Colonists didn't know how trendy they were.

Id: [0x0006CBD6]
!*Cloth formed the largest import during the 18th century, and tailoring was largest trade in metropolitan areas for an even longer period. Since togas had long since gone out of style, tailors were necessary, since everyone the cloth turned into clothes.<br><br>Tailors dealt with people from all walks of society: men, women and children, rich or poor, taking their measurements and producing fitted garments.  These would often be of similar design; only the fabric in which they were cut would mark the social standing of the wearer.

Id: [0x0006CBD7]
!*Blacksmithing was a crucial activity in colonial America, and the blacksmith was often considered to be the most important person in a village. Forges and “tin shops” provided everyday items, from household utensils to farming tools and building supplies, nails, hammers, axes and such, along with the all-important horseshoes (think of them as being like tyres for your car. Essential for travel, really).<br><br>Blacksmiths were also a vital part of the logistical chain of any army, since their highly specialized skills were required to either produce or repair weapons and military equipment of all kind, in addition to providing assistance in taking care of horses. Unsurprising, really - if you're working with a lot of metal things that are often broken, it's handy to have someone around who can fix them.

Id: [0x0006CBD8]
!*During the Revolutionary War, medical knowledge and practices were only beginning to evolve to what they are today. Doctors and nurses were rare, often lacked formal training and very few of them had any sort of specialization. Treatments were rudimentary for the most part, and there was still heavy reliance on bleeding to treat infections. (I trust I don't have to tell you that doesn't work very well at all.) The instruments they used probably didn't look much different from torture devices - which makes them sound a bit like a visit to my dentist, really.<br><br>Of course, there were people who began to take a deep and genuine interest in the application of scientific principles in pursuing knowledge of medicine. They would document and share information with their peers to increase the collective knowledge - generally a good idea - which led to a general increase of the quality of diagnosis and treatments. Unfortunately, things only improved very slowly, so if you're thinking of just popping in because you're feeling under the weather, it might be best to wait a century or so.

Id: [0x0006CBD9]
!*Inns and taverns were central to colonial life. In addition to being a place where people would meet around a meal, drink a few ales, or discuss important matters for the community, they were stations for travellers - offering a roof, a warm bed or a clean floor, a hot meal and often care for one’s horse - which is nice, because you wouldn't want your horse to feel left out. <br><br>Innkeepers were important figures both locally and regionally, because they dealt with a great many people, from humble labourers to campaigning Generals. This made them a prime source of news: any innkeepers worth their salt knew everyone for miles around their inn, and they generally made sure everyone knew them, too.

Modifications to the targeting system. You should be able to move in and out of combat more easily. <br><br>2. Free-running improvements. You’re less likely to jump at the wrong time/in the wrong direction.<br><br>3. Only one input for interacting with the world. No more choosing between parts of your ancestor’s body. <br><br>4. You can assassinate while moving now. Definitely try it out ASAP! You can pick up weapons on the go as well.<br><br>5. We implemented a weather system. Rain, snow, wind – it’s all there!<br><br>6. ANIMALS!! (Nuff said)<br><br>7. Faster fast travel. Just open your map and you can instantly travel to any unlocked fast travel station.<br><br>8. Revamped the map. It now provides lots of additional information and you’ve got more control over what it shows.<br><br>There’s a ton of other stuff, but your dad is yelling at me to get back to work, so I’d better wrap this up.

Can't afford to lose anyone because curiosity got the better of them. We're short-handed as is.

!*Hey there Desmond! As you'll see from the date of this email, you've been in the Animus for a few days now. But don't worry!! I've been staying on top of your vitals. Not even a blip! So it looks like extending the sessions won't be a problem. Whatever happened between you and 16 seems to have increased your tolerance. The Animus keeps you in a resting state which takes care of fatigue - and your memories are vivid enough we're actually seeing micro-movement in your muscles, which means no atrophy issues either. Still, we'll be bringing you out for breaks just to stay on the safe side.

Or maybe it’s part of his snarky British “charm”. Or maybe it’s how he deals with the stress. Whatever it is, it’s getting old real fast. We’ve got enough to worry about – you know, end of the world and everything... You’d think he’d show a little restraint or maturity or SOMETHING. Sorry... not like you need to hear me venting. You’ve got enough on your plate. Please don’t say anything to him, though!!!

Even slept in the same room when we put down for the night. Anyway – don’t mean to be a busybody. Just didn’t want you to stay sore with him. Not too sore, anyway. The man means well - even if he's got an odd way of showing it.

Creeped me out.<br><br>I don't know if she's reaching out to us from the past, if some part of her is actually still conscious, or if maybe she's inside the Apple, like some evil genie.

Some of us prefer to use PROPER language when corresponding. The database keeps trying to replace the letter s with zed in certain words. And it's declared war on the letter u as well. Realise becomes realize and colour becomes color. Wrong wrong wrong! <br><br>It's all rather ethnocentric, if you ask me. Also quite against the principles of the Assassin Brotherhood, last I checked. And here I thought we were meant to be an all inclusive bunch...

Rebecca’s been monitoring your sessions. I’m hoping to duplicate some of the recordings and send them to other cells for further research. Also hoping there’s a way to bypass some of these memories, but synchronization seems to dictate you progress in chronological order. Hopefully some day we'll have a way to move through memories more quickly. Would certainly save us a lot of time in situations like this.

But it appears he was a Templar from pretty early on. Maybe he took them from someone. It’s happened before. And they’re quite handy. I’m surprised more Templars haven’t put them to use. Pretty easy to build a pair if you know what you’re doing...

!*Charles Lee was a British soldier who went on to be a major figure in the Revolutionary War.<br><br>Lee's father was a Colonel in the British army, and started his son off in a military career early. He was sent to a military academy in Switzerland during his formative years, and then in 1746, Lee became an ensign in his father's regiment.<br><br>Lee was sent to the colonies in 1755 to fight in the French and Indian war. He served under Edward Braddock and then later at Fort Ticonderoga, where he was injured in the fighting. Lee recovered, and later fought at Fort Niagara. I’d always thought there were a lot of Fort fights fought. He finished his time in the colonies with the British conquest of Montreal.<br><br>Lee returned to England in 1760, possibly because he was seeking career advancement. He was named a Major in 1761 and was sent to fight the Spanish in Portugal. Though his service record there was good, Lee didn't receive praise on his return home - in fact, he was retired from the army at half-pay. After that, Lee became a vocal critic of military higher-ups, and the British Prime Minister - and found that his military career had (inexplicably!) completely stalled.<br><br>**<br><br>Frustrated with his lack of advancement with the British, Lee moved back to New York in 1773. He quickly became a supporter of the revolutionary cause and in June of 1775 he joined the Continental Army with the rank of Major General. <br><br>Lee began his service under the command of George Washington - which grated, since Lee had some hopes of being named Commander-in-Chief of the army himself. Given Lee's experience he might have had a point, but he also had his drawbacks. Most notable was his temper - Lee was quick to anger, and had a habit of being very vocally and publicly angry when he didn't get his way. Bosses LOVE that.<br><br>Lee also had some rather odd personal quirks. He was exceptionally fond of dogs, and was continually surrounded by them, in particular his much-loved Pomeranian.  Never trust a man continually surrounded by tiny dogs. He was also vain and liked tailored suits, but rarely washed them, meaning that he smelled little better than his animals (and worse, according to some.)<br><br>Despite his failings, Lee was both a competent leader and popular with the troops. Washington recognized it, and named one of the forts on the Hudson River "Fort Lee", in his honour. If Washington was hoping that just naming a fort after him smooth over their rocky relationship, it amazingly didn't work.<br><br>In fact, as time went on, Lee became less and less fond of Washington, and became reluctant to follow his orders at all. When Washington retreated across New York and New Jersey in 1776, he sent several commands to Lee to follow him, which Lee did, but very slowly. Which may be what resulted in him being left behind and captured by the British in 1776. Still. It’s understandable. He probably had to stop every five minutes to let his bloody dogs piss in a hedge.<br><br>Fortunately for Lee, he'd resigned his commission in the British army shortly after taking on his role in the Continental Army. That meant instead of being tried for being a deserter, his imprisonment in New York was more of an inconvenience. He was wined and dined by the British, allowed to have whomever he wanted as a dinner guest. It was basically a bed and breakfast. In return, Lee gave up information about the state of the Continental Army.

Maybe he’d forgotten his doggie treats in the tent and needed to go and get them. Washington swept in and took command, turning a complete rout of his army into a draw, and Lee received a very thorough and public dressing down. Afterward, Lee demanded an apology or a court-martial to clear his name. <br><br>Washington chose the court-martial, which didn't go as Lee had hoped. He was found guilty of "misbehaviour before the enemy, making a shameful and disorderly retreat, and disrespect to the commander-in-chief". He was only given a year's suspension for the crimes, but by the time the year was over, he'd been so vocal in his criticism of Washington that Congress removed him from the army permanently.<br><br>Lee retired to his estate in Virginia, passing his time breeding more dogs. After his death, he was given a full military funeral - getting all the respect he craved, too late to do anything with it.

He'll be appointed head of the medical wing of the Continental Army in 1775, but for God’s sake don’t tell him, it’ll go straight to his head. <br><br>Church goes on to become a vocal Patriot – which makes him sound like a member of a weird barbershop quartet. But he was a member of the Sons of Liberty, and his local Committee of Correspondence.

That's when he was caught sending coded messages to the British forces in Boston.  Rather than being hanged for treason, Church was simply jailed and later exiled. That took some fast talking on his part. His defense was that he was actually HELPING the Continental Army by exaggerating troop estimates and gunpowder stores. That’s some quick thinking.<br><br>Lucky for Church the Continental Army only ever knew about the one coded letter. More modern research has showed that he'd been ferrying papers to the British for some time, possibly to pay off some of his debts.<br><br>Incidentally, his expensive mansion was seized by the newly formed American government and sold to pay off war debts - but not until after it was ransacked by angry rebels. That may seem like poetic justice, but it's somewhat unfair - at the time Church wasn't even living there. He'd left it to his wife, who he'd abandoned for another woman.<br><br>Seems he made a habit of betrayal. What a catch.

He sounds like someone who’d betray HIMSELF (if the other him paid the first him well enough.)

!*Here's a name even you should recognise - George Washington, who will go on to be the leader of the army during the American Revolution, and the first President of the United States. <br><br>I was going to say you probably know everything I'm going to tell you but that would be a lie. What you know is that George Washington has a lot of things named after him, and anything else you learned in school you forgot because you thought you'd never use it in real life. (You should call your history teacher and tell her she was right all along.)<br><br>George Washington was the son of a planter from Virginia. He was raised with little education, but was ambitious, teaching himself mostly from books. <br><br>Washing started in business early, speculating on land starting at the age of 18. When he was 20, his older brother died, leaving him the heir of the family plantation at Mount Vernon - where he lived until his death, and where you can still visit his grave today.<br><br>Washington got his military start during the French and Indian War, leading an expedition to Fort Duquesne in 1754 - a destination he never reached, having surrendered at Fort Necessity. The next year, Washington headed to Fort Duquesne again, this time as a guide for Edward Braddock during the ill-fated Braddock Expedition. Washington went as a volunteer, hoping that working for Braddock would get him a track to military promotion. Though the battle was a rout, Washington earned credit for organizing the retreat, and later that year he was made a Colonel in charge of the Virginia militia.<br><br>Washington completely revamped the militia, with hopes that under his organization and training they would be accepted into the British military. They never were. Washington resigned his post in 1758. I won't say the snub led to his contempt for the British, but snubs rarely help. <br><br>By the late 1760s, Washington had become active in political life - taking on a role in the Virginia House of Burgesses. He went on to be a member of the Continental Congress, and when war broke out in 1775, he was Congress's choice to lead the army. At the time Washington said, "I do not think myself equal to the command I am honored with." Which I'm sure inspired complete confidence in everyone who heard it. Imagine if you were on an airplane and the captain opened with that.<br><br>It's possible Washington was being falsely modest, but the fact is this: he wasn't a military genius, and he knew it. (Though I'm sure it hurts your American pride to hear me say he wasn't perfect.) Washington had several narrow misses where the army could have easily been obliterated - at Manhattan, and again at Brandywine - among others.<br><br>Washington won an early victory he broke the siege of Boston, but he then made the disastrous move of fortifying New York - a city he couldn't defend without a navy he didn't have. Even you can work that one out. He spent the latter half of 1776 retreating across New York and New Jersey, losing battle after battle, until Christmas, when he pulled off a successful surprise attack the Hessian troops at Trenton. <br><br>(And while that battle makes for some famous paintings, and it did rally the flagging confidence of the public, it was a minor victory in the war.)<br><br>**<br><br>Washington's lack of skill didn't go unremarked, either. Charles Lee lost faith in him completely - never going quite so far as to disobey Washington's orders, but not following them promptly either.  Then, in 1777-78, Washington had to defend himself against the Conway Cabal, which threatened to replace him with General Horatio Gates.<br><br>However, Washington's strength lay in politics, and leading the army was as much about politics as it was about winning battles. Washington had to negotiate between the varying interests of the army, the individual colonies, and Congress - and not just for instructions on how to wage the war, but also for basic supplies for the troops. By all accounts he must have been extremely patient - trying to get politicians to give you anything is like trying to get a dog to give up a bone. (Actually, my money would be on the dogs, who will occasionally listen to reason.)<br><br>Whatever the criticisms of Washington's military strengths, the bottom line is that he won (eventually).  When the revolution ended, he was the unanimous choice for President, a credit to the fact that he managed to both win the war and not alienate anyone in Congress.  <br><br>Of course, if you're looking for something to criticize Washington for, you don't have to look far - he ordered the total ruin of Indigenous settlements during the Sullivan Expedition, not to mention he was a plantation owner, which meant he owned more than 200 slaves (And while, yes, his will did provide for them being freed - after both he and his wife were dead and wouldn't need them anymore. I don't really consider that particularly altruistic.)<br><br>Oh, am I ending on a low note? Sorry, I'm here to teach you history, not soothe your sense of national pride.

!*Nicholas Biddle was an ambitious young sailor who became one of the first captains of the Continental Navy.   <br><br>Biddle joined the Royal Navy in 1770 (I mean the British side), but when the American Revolution started he offered his services to the Continental Congress. So a traitor, then - though it’s funny how you lot don’t generally see it that way. Anyway, while he was only a midshipman for the British, Congress quickly gave him command of his own ship, the Franklin. In 1776 was offered an even better deal - command of a brand new ship, named the Randolph.<br><br>History's mute on the reasons behind Biddle's rise to prominence. However, I think I might be able to solve the mystery - we saw Church recruiting him when Connor stopped at Nantucket.  <br><br>Biddle eventually became a privateer for the Continental Congress, patrolling British shipping routes, harassing their ships and keeping the spoils from any he could capture. He had a reputation as an excellent captain –he divided the spoils evenly, and never used corporal punishment against his crew. What a softy. Pitiful, really. Though I think you can see why that would be a job perk.<br><br>**<br>It seems that Biddle was angling to be head of the Continental Navy - but like several other officers of the time, he didn't want to serve under Washington. <br>Incidentally the circumstances of Biddle’s death - and the exact reason his ship exploded - have always been something of an historical mystery.

!*William Johnson was a land speculator, and Britain's principal treaty negotiator with the Indigenous peoples in the northern part of the colonies - particularly the Iroquois.<br><br>Johnson was born in Ireland, but moved to the colonies in 1738 to look after his Uncle's property on the Mohawk River. However, it wasn't long before Johnson branched out into business for himself, acquiring property on the opposite side of the river and setting up a sawmill and trading post, which he named "Mount Johnson". Which to me always sounds like mating instructions from a caveman. In 1743 he moved to an even larger parcel of land which he named "Fort Johnson". (He may have been an excellent businessman, but it's possible he lacked an imagination.)<br><br>Johnson befriended the Indigenous peoples in the area, particularly the Kanien'kehá:ka - whose language he learned. His respect for their customs helped him rise to prominence as liaison between the Iroquois peoples and the British government. Johnson was named Superintendent of Indian Affairs in 1756. As a contact who knows the land and its people, he's probably the best you'll find.<br><br>**<br><br>In addition to treaty negotiations, Johnson was in charge of recruiting and leading Iroquois fighters during the French and Indian War. He only fought in one battle, but he was rewarded handsomely for his service - £5000 and a Baronetcy. That was a little above average for most people involved in that battle.<br><br>He continued his close ties with the Kanien'kehá:ka and in 1760 they gave him land totaling more than 300 square kilometres as a thanks for his work. <br><br>However, Johnson burned some bridges in 1768 when he negotiated the Treaty of Fort Stanwix. He took much more land than the British had asked for - a windfall for him, since he could then speculate on it - but rather a tough sell to the Indigenous nations who lived on the land. The treaty caused a war in Virginia (known as Dunmore's War). In an effort to stop more bloodshed (and possibly to cover his own arse), Johnson called for more negotiations - this time at Johnson Hall, in 1774.

I suppose a blow to the head, for example, could be described as a very heavy stroke.

No record of him being on the 'American' side of the colonies but it seems he did some covert work as well - that would explain the lack of details. <br><br>Pitcairn was promoted to Major in 1771, and he gained a reputation for being well-liked by his subordinates - and praised by his enemies.

I'm still puzzled as to why he'd try negotiating a truce with an army at his back, though. It sort of sends the wrong message, don't you think?

!*Thomas Hickey was an Irish-born member of the British Army. He arrived in Boston in 1752, but it wasn't long before he was assigned to William Johnson's personal guard, apparently at Johnson's request (possibly because their families were connected in Ireland, or maybe he found the name ‘Hickey’ funny, the record isn't clear.)<br><br> Hickey served under Johnson during the French and Indian war, but then he left the army after being written up several times for disorderly conduct. After 1760, Hickey disappears from the historical record for several years. I do, however, have several mentions in William Johnson's household accounts of payments made to "T.H.". It's possible Hickey was working for him as a spy. If so, he should really have developed some tougher codes to crack.<br><br>**<br><br>Hickey resurfaces during the rebel occupation of New York in 1776. He became a member of George Washington's personal bodyguard - commonly known among the soldiers as the "Life Guard". I'd imagine it took some pretty clever political maneuvering to get him there, given his record. I've seen some suggestions that he was a well-respected member of the Connecticut Militia, but I can't find a service record for him there (and I have my doubts Hickey could ever have been described as 'well-respected').<br><br>In any case, Hickey immediately betrayed his commission by planning to assassinate Washington. Maybe T.H. stood for That Hooligan.

That's an interesting interpretation of events, but since New York didn't have stadium seating at the time, I doubt many of the soldiers had a great view of the execution. The important message for them was "Don't be a traitor, you'll get hanged", not the niceties of who was on the gibbet.

!*Edward 'Bulldog' Braddock was the Major General placed in charge of British troops at the beginning of the French and Indian War, probably because he had a nickname like ‘Bulldog’.<br><br>Braddock was serving as the acting Governor of Gibraltar when he received the command in North America. He was given control of two regiments of Regulars and assigned to win back Fort Duquesne from the French (known as the Braddock Expedition) - as part of a larger attack on the French colonies on the continent.<br><br>Braddock had been well-liked as the governor in Gibraltar, but things changed once he reached North America. He had been known for keeping strict order among his troops, but it seems he went beyond that into brutality. He gained a reputation for being quick-tempered and cruel. He also displayed a contempt for non-British soldiers that alienated the colonial militia he was trying to recruit. So a cruel, racist bulldog, then. They’re my least favourite type of bulldog.<br><br>Braddock took a bullet to the chest during a battle in 1755, rumour has it from one of his own soldiers.  Which is a job hazard when you're nasty to the people around you and they all have guns. Sounds like the bulldog may have been put down.<br><br>**<br><br>It was George Washington who carried Braddock from the field on his sash - which Braddock then entrusted to Washington. (That 'carrying' bit may sound a bit odd, but that sash is bigger than it looks - more than three metres long - and doubled as a field hammock. It says something about officers that they'd wear a piece of clothing designed to carry their body off the battlefield - which would also single them out for getting shot at. The ways of war are mysterious.)  Braddock died of his injuries a few days later; Washington kept the sash.<br><br>Here's something interesting - because of concerns that enemy soldiers would desecrate Braddock's body, he was buried under the road, so the wagons would run over the earth and hide the gravesite.  In 1804, roadworkers rediscovered the remains and they were moved to another site - which is now marked by a marble monument.

Id: [0x0006CF10]
!*These are some of the most sought-after technological remnants from the ever-mysterious First Civilization. The apples were originally created by our friendly First Civ masters in order to control the huddled masses - that is, humanity. These artifacts can control minds and create illusions that pretty much everyone is susceptible to. They're also repositories of First Civilization knowledge - meaning if you know how to access them, you can use the Apples to develop incredibly advanced technology. <br><br>Naturally, the raw power of the apples have made them a target of ambitious and unscrupulous types for centuries, and have been used by leaders throughout history to influence the course of important events. The Assassin mentor Al Mualim had one in Masyaf in the 12th century - but he succumbed to its power and began to use it for control, rather than research. (Turns out that old saying about absolute power corrupting absolutely is true). <br><br>It eventually passed into the hands of Al Mualim’s star pupil, Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, a Levantine Assassin who unlocked its true power and purpose, then had the good sense to lock it away in a vault, far from greedy hands. But nothing this valuable stays put for long, and in the final years of the 16th century Templars working for Queen Elizabeth of England sent out an envoy to find and recover it.  <br><br>This apple – Apple number two, to be precise - ultimately made its way into Abstergo’s hands in the 20th century, and was the lynchpin of their current plan to subdue and suppress all free thought and action in the world … until they blew the damn thing up in a pretty dodgy experiment. Since that time we learned of the existence of at least five more apples, the sixth of which once belonged to the Italian assassin Ezio Auditore, and which you, Desmond, were kind enough to recover for us. So thanks for that. (and you might wish to make a note of the date – my thanks are few and far between…)<br><br>This sixth apple has an equally storied history, and first came to attention of modern Templars after the Ottoman Mehmet II used it to compel the besieged Byzantines to open the gates of Constantinople and let their enemies walk right in. A few decades on, Mehmet’s grandson, Cem – a young man with loose Templar allegiances – stole the apple and hid it in an abandoned Templar archive on Cyprus, hoping to use it as a bargaining chip in his dealings with the powerful Rodrigo Borgia. But this parlay ended badly for the wayward Ottoman prince. He was captured by the Hospitallers on Rhodes and tortured until he revealed the apple’s location. In 1486 Rodrigo sent a group of Templars to locate the apple and deliver it to him.<br><br>But on the eve of this apple’s arrival in Venice in 1488, Ezio and his Assassins intercepted it and claimed it as their own. Over the next two decades the sixth apple changed hands a few times, falling into the clutches of both Girolamo Savonarola and Cesare Borgia, before finding its penultimate resting-place in a vault below Santa Maria in Aracoeli. I say penultimate because it's in our hands, and I’ll be damned if I know where it’s going to end up after the mess we’re in now.<br><br>Whatever happens, I have to give our ancient ancestors their due. It is incredible to consider that, millennia after the First Civ has been wiped from the earth, the apples are still working perfectly – a fact that is nothing short of amazing, given that I need to replace my mobile phone every other year, and that bloody fridge is still on the blink.

So much for injecting a little pre-Christmas cheer into these otherwise dour proceedings...<br><br>The GOOD NEWS is that far as I can tell, the Eye-Abstergo launch has been postponed - permanently. With Vidic dead (thanks to dear Desmond) and the Apple of Eden still safely in our possession, there's no way they'll make their date. I suppose there's always the chance they'll manage to retrieve another Apple and start the whole process over - but all of our intel says they've got no leads. We're safe from that particular threat - at least for now.<br><br>The BAD NEWS is that we've got less than 48 hours to open the temple doors.

!*Paine was political pamphleteer, originally from England. His book "Common Sense" was an argument for American independence - and became one of the most popular books in American history, mainly because Americans thought it was a book about common sense, and on some level knew they needed it.<br><br>At the time, most of the literature about independence was written by lawyers and politicians - in the kind of self-important florid language that can only be understood by college graduates or written by me. However, "Common Sense" lived up to its title - it was written in straightforward language, so basically anyone could understand its arguments (even people who couldn't read - the book was so popular there were numerous public readings of the text, making it an early audiobook, in many ways.)<br><br>While the book wasn't what convinced Congress of the value of independence (they already knew), it did cause a groundswell of popular support, and that was important because Congress needed the public on their side - and they needed to convince soldiers to fight for them. Common Sense did both.<br><br>I don't have any record of Connor actually meeting Paine, but I thought you'd like to know about him as his works played such a crucial role in the revolution. Yes, I put this at the end so you'd read the whole thing before finding that out. I can be a bastard that way.

!*Casimir Pulaski (or to use the Polish spelling, Kazimierz Pulaski) was a Polish noble and cavalry leader who fought on the side of the rebels during the American Revolution.<br><br>Pulaski was a fighter in the Polish Resistance during the late 1760s and early 1770s. Unfortunately for him, he was on the losing side and had to flee to France. Poor guy. Having to flee to France. There, he met Benjamin Franklin, who was keeping an eye out for any experienced military commanders who could help the rebel war effort. Franklin wasted no time in sending Pulaski in the direction of George Washington. <br><br>Pulaski joined the Continental Army in 1777 and made himself immediately useful at the Battle of Brandywine - where he prevented George Washington from being surrounded by the British. He probably saved Washington's life - along with the lives of many in of the Continental Army. As a thank-you, Pulaski was named a Brigadier General and placed in command of the Continental Army's cavalry - which at the time was extremely small, scattered, and mainly used for scouting.  <br><br>After some tensions with his superior officers, Pulaski resigned his commission and was allowed to start again elsewhere, training a small corps of lancers and infantry that - for reasons which should be obvious - became known as "Pulaski's Legion".

Id: [0x0006CFE8]
!*Simon Girty was a hunter and trader in the Ohio Valley, who worked for the British during the American Revolution.<br><br>Girty was born near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania at a time when it was contested territory between the European Colonists and the local Indigenous nations. When Girty was in his early teens, his family was captured by a Seneca war party, so Girty spent several years as an adoptee, learning the Seneca language (and probably several other languages as well).  Those skills would come in handy - Girty eventually became an interpreter, most famously between the Iroquois and the British during the later years of the American Revolution. <br><br>I don't mean 'famously' in a good way, by the way. Girty had a reputation as a heavy drinker, with a volatile temper and boorish manners. During one of his raids on the Continental Army, some of the Delaware in the party tortured a Patriot colonel to death. Depending on which account you believe, Girty either pleaded for the colonel's life - or encouraged his torturers and taunted him as he died. <br><br>Of course, since Girty was on the losing side of the war and not a particularly sympathetic figure, most history books take the dimmer view of his actions.

!*Reginald Birch was a London merchant, the son of another London merchant (who, conveniently enough, also had the last name Birch. It seems it was one of those hard-to-put-your-finger-on things that ran in the family). <br><br>Birch started in business for himself at an early age. By the time he was in his mid-20s, he already owned several merchant ships, mainly dealing with the tea trade to the American colonies. That's pretty good going, seeing as by the time most people are in their mid-20s they don’t even own a shirt. I have him as part owner of the Providence, among others. Later in life, Birch also owned several businesses in and around London. He was a member of White's, which was a posh Gentleman's club in London - and generally a well-known and respected man-about-town.<br><br>From what I can tell, Birch met Haytham Kenway while working for his father, Edward. They were introduced at White's while Haytham was still quite young.  Birch would eventually take over Haytham's education - tutoring him while on a tour of Europe in the 1730s. From what we've seen in the Animus, it seems their friendship continued into adulthood - with them working together as members of the Assassins. <br><br>**<br><br>So, further evidence (that is, the Animus) reveals that Birch was a Templar all along - likely a Grand Master in the order. I'll be honest and say I really didn't see that coming. And that is startlingly honest of me. In fact, I instantly regret it. In any case I'm still making the connections on how exactly this all relates to the Assassins - our records from the time are like a teenage back. Spotty at best. I'll update you if I find anything more.

!*You may not think it to look at him how, but this man was once the Mentor of a powerful branch of the Assassins - the Colonial Brotherhood.  <br><br>Achilles' life before he was an Assassin isn't well documented – it seems that most of the records were destroyed when the Templars nearly wiped out the order in 1763. <br><br>From what I do have, Achilles was recruited in the mid-1730s and became a Mentor in 1746. He had a gift for both recruitment and organization, so before long was head of a crew of Assassins that spanned the colonies and much of the frontier. Achilles strengthened the ties between the order and the nations of the Iroquois confederacy, particularly the Kanien'kehá:ka, though as far as our records show, Connor is the first Native American to actually become an Assassin.<br><br>**<br><br>The Brotherhood's growth came to a grinding halt in 1763, when an attack (presumably orchestrated by Haytham Kenway) wiped out 90% of the colonial Assassins in one strike. Though Achilles' correspondence with Britain shows that he was suspicious of Haytham and his intentions, there's no indication that he knew an ambush was coming - an oversight of nightmarish proportions on his part.<br><br>Achilles managed to survive the attack, but he retired from the order - until a decade had passed, and Connor convinced him to grudgingly take on one more student.

!*The Conway Cabal was a supposed conspiracy to unseat George Washington as the head of the Continental Army and replace him with General Horatio Gates.

He served as a General under Washington, but corresponded frequently with Gates - mainly about how bad Washington was at his job.<br><br>Now, generally if you want to keep your job, you don’t bitch about your boss to everyone who'll listen, but apparently nobody ever told Conway that. He wouldn’t last five minutes on any social networking site. So, when Washington got wind of some things Conway had written (none of which were complimentary), it exploded in the faces of both Conway and Gates, who had to go before Congress to clear their names. (Which didn't work out for them.) <br><br>There's some historical debate as to whether "Cabal" is the right word for the whole thing - and really, it sounds more like an internal squabble to me. However, there was some very public criticism of Washington at the time, since he's just lost the battles at Germantown and Brandywine, while Gates had won a big victory at Saratoga. It's not surprising that Washington took Conway's letters as a sign that his subordinates were conspiring behind his back to replace him. <br><br>In the end, however, Washington's supporters rallied around him and the whole thing ended with Gates apologising and Conway being forced to resign.<br> <br>And that would have been it, except that despite resigning Conway remained very publicly critical of Washington. That is, until one of Washington's supporters put a stop to it - by shooting him in the mouth. Simple, effective – though not generally in the employer’s manual.

!*This was a network of rebel spies operating in New York and Connecticut from 1778 until the end of the American Revolution.<br><br>The group was founded after British forces left Philadelphia and re-established their headquarters in New York City. Washington knew that he needed people on the inside (I've always wanted to use that phrase, and between you and me, I also got quite a kick out of ‘rebel spies’) to report on British troop movements. He asked his newly-appointed head of intelligence, Benjamin Tallmadge, to find some spies, which Tallmadge did.<br><br>Tallmadge needed people he could trust absolutely, so he began by recruiting his childhood friends. (Nothing says friendship quite like offering someone a job that involves risking their life.) The name "Culper Ring" is taken from "Samuel Culper Sr." and "Samuel Culper Jr.", the code names of two of the ring's main informants. I don’t know who they were, but I imagine one was slightly older than the other.<br><br>The group's biggest accomplishment was probably informing Washington of a planned attack on the French forces in Rhode Island in 1780. They're also credited with uncovering Benedict Arnold's betrayal of West Point - though the evidence for that is sketchier. In any case, the ring delivered secret messages for years, with none of its members ever being captured (with one possible exception - a woman referred to as "355", whose real identity and fate isn't known.) <br><br>The group is credited for being the most effective intelligence operation in the war - on either side. You can't know how much it pains me to write that. It took AGES.

!*EVACUATION DAY (NEW YORK)

Id: [0x0006D00F]
!*Evacuation Day was the day that the British troops sailed out of New York City at the end of the American Revolution. (Not to be confused with Evacuation Day in Massachusetts - where the British sailed out of Boston Harbour, nearer to the beginning of the Revolution.)<br><br>While the Treaty of Paris formally ended the war in early September, the British took some time to pack up their belongings and leave their stronghold at New York - mainly because many Loyalists found a sudden need to leave the country, and so there were more people to carry than they originally anticipated. Plus, they probably wanted some time in Duty Free.<br><br>Of course, the British are known for being practical jokers, and so they couldn't resist getting in a few friendly parting shots. Before they left, troops nailed a Union Jack to a flagpole on the Bowling Green - and then greased the pole.  Undaunted, the Americans nailed up spikes to help them climb, managing to raise Stars-and-Stripes before the British fleet had sailed out of sight. After that, climbing a greased flag pole to tear down a Union Jack would be part of New York's Evacuation Day festivities - proving that you Americans need better hobbies.<br><br>The other British parting shot was a literal one - a British ship fired a cannonball at the crowds on Staten Island, who were jeering at the departing flotilla. Nobody was hurt - the ball fell short of the land - but it's sometimes called the last shot of the American Revolution.<br><br>Evacuation Day isn't much celebrated any more - it fell out of favour when Thanksgiving was moved to the end of November, in 1863.

!*SMALLPOX INNOCULATION

Id: [0x0006D012]
!*Smallpox was one of the scourges of the 17th and 18th centuries. The list of symptoms is thoroughly pleasant - large pustules all over your skin that are more or less guaranteed to scar, terrible fever, and vomiting. (The disease is extinct now aside from samples kept in laboratories - yet another reason to be glad we live in this modern age.)<br><br>Inoculation for smallpox in America began sometime in the early 1720s in Boston, when a preacher named Cotton Mather found out about the idea from one of his slaves. The method was simple, if rather disgusting - you find someone who has a mild case of the disease, then grind up parts of their sores, and put it under the skin of the person being inoculated (generally in a scratch between the thumb and forefinger). The second person would get a less severe form of the disease, and afterward will be immune for about 10 years.<br><br>Statistically speaking, inoculation worked, but it wasn't without its drawbacks. Smallpox in any form was extremely dangerous, and people regularly died from being inoculated. Also, because inoculating people was essentially infecting them with the disease there was always the chance that they could cause an outbreak. (A case of the cure being worse than the disease.)<br><br>It wasn't until 1796 that a less dangerous form of vaccination was introduced. A British doctor – of course he was British - named Edward Jenner discovered that being infected with cowpox (which was non-lethal) would give immunity to smallpox as well.  Jenner had made this discovery by infecting a young boy with cowpox, and then trying to infect him with smallpox (in the name of science, I'm sure the child would have been delighted to know). Given his methods, it's not surprising Jenner's findings were frowned upon by the medical establishment, and cowpox-based vaccinations didn't see wide use until sometime after 1800.

!*You know, it's rather incredible the way your lunatic fringe tries to conjure the "spirit" of the Founding Fathers to support their various causes. And by incredible I mean hilarious. They hold up slave-owning, sexist, homophobes as if that's some sort of ideal to which one should aspire.<br><br>Oh - and in case you think I added that last bit for fun (as the sexism and slavery bits are already common knowledge): sodomy was a criminal offense in every one of the thirteen colonies except for Georgia and Thomas Jefferson ('champion' of personal liberty that he was) advocated for the castration of homosexuals. Lovely fellows, these founding fathers of yours. And now there's that new bit of madness with people asking for the removal of textbook references to their slave-owning...<br><br>And before you think to turn it back 'round and (rightly) point out their barbarism was inspired by English law - last I checked, two stupids don't make a smart. I thought the whole point of the Revolution was to break free of the old ways... And it certainly doesn't recommend your founders as the sort of persons one should aspire to become. Unless you aspire to become a manipulative bigot.<br><br>Lest you think I'm championing some sort of leftist agenda, I'll gladly shame the internet tough guys who celebrate the Treaty of Tripoli as well. Shame on them for thinking it shows anything other than something taken straight out of The First Grader's Guide to International Relations... Its intent wasn't to prove America wasn't a Christian nation. They were saying they weren't going to reignite the Crusades. No, that would be delayed for a couple of centuries. Now, I don't believe your founding fathers wanted to establish a theocracy. And they probably did intend for the country to be welcoming of all religions. But this isn't proof of that.<br><br>I suppose the point I'm trying to make is that people might want to spend a little less time romanticizing and manipulating the past (fat chance, that) and a bit more time focusing on how to improve the future (fatter chance still). <br><br>That's not say there isn't plenty to be learned from looking back - because there is! It's just that most of those lessons wind up ignored or perverted these days. At best it's disingenuous and unproductive. At worst (and often) it's rather dangerous.

!*Bowls is a variety of the old “boules” family of games derived somewhere around the 12th or 13th century. Similar to today’s pétanque and Italian bocce, the game is played by two players or teams of players with up to four people per team. Each player takes turns rolling biased balls in such a way as to stop near the “jack”, a smaller ball tossed at the beginning of a bout, or “end”. Once both players have rolled all their balls (four per side in a two-player game), points are awarded for each ball closest to the jack.

Sometimes referred to as “Cowboy Checkers,” Nine Men’s Morris is a board game that dates back at least to the Roman Empire. It is played on a board with nine stones for each player. Players alternately place stones, three stones in a row gives a player the right to remove an opposing stone.

Id: [0x0006D1B1]
Fanorona is believed to have originated in Madagascar. It is played on a nine-row by five-column board of intersecting lines. Each player places twenty-two black or white pieces on the board, then tries to capture the opponent’s pieces by moving his own along the lines and either “approaching” an opposing stone or “withdrawing” from one.

Id: [0x0006D1B2]
Checkers, or English draughts, is one of the oldest games known to man. It is played on a checkered board where two players alternate moving one of twelve flat cylindrical pieces. The goal of the game is to capture the opposing player’s pieces by jumping over them. Although simple in principle, the game's difficulty becomes apparent with experience.

!*1 INTRODUCTION

Id: [0x0006D5C0]
!*1.1 The Cast

Id: [0x0006D5C1]
!*1.1.1 Desmond Miles

Id: [0x0006D5C2]
!*The descendant of the Assassins Aquilus, Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, Ezio Auditore, and Ratonhnhaké:ton, Desmond Miles (born in 1987) was a member of the Assassin Brotherhood who left the organization when he was a teenager. In September 2012, he was captured by Abstergo Industries and forced to relive the memories of his ancestors through a machine called the Animus. Desmond later escaped and began to work with a small group of Assassins, returning to the Animus in order to help them circumvent the Templars’ plans.

Id: [0x0006D5C3]
!*1.1.2       Shaun Hastings

Id: [0x0006D5C4]
!*Shaun Hastings is a member of the modern-day Assassin Brotherhood. Working as an analyst and researcher, he is responsible for compiling and maintaining the knowledge archives of the Animus. Additionally, he provides tactical support and intelligence to Assassin cells around the world. While the nature of Shaun's work is mostly cerebral and he spends much of his time behind a desk rather than in the field, his contribution is instrumental in the ongoing race between Assassins and Templars to secure the remaining Pieces of Eden.

Id: [0x0006D5C5]
!*1.1.3       Rebecca Crane

Id: [0x0006D5C6]
!*Unlike most Assassins, Rebecca Crane was not born into the Brotherhood. Instead, she was actively recruited for her technical skills, which were supplemented by rigorous combat training upon her induction into the ranks of the Assassins. Within her team, Rebecca holds a support role alongside Shaun Hastings. Despite the dire circumstances that she and her team find themselves in, Rebecca remains a very optimistic and outgoing person. Friendly with her teammates and quick to joke, she sometimes seems immature despite how seriously she takes their mission and her work.

Id: [0x0006D5C7]
!*1.1.4       William Miles

Id: [0x0006D5C8]
!*William Miles (born 1948) is the driven, intelligent, but emotionally distant father of Desmond Miles. Born within the Assassin community, he has devoted his entire life to the ideals of the Brotherhood. He raised his son in a remote Assassin community called The Farm, located in the Black Hills of South Dakota, outside Rapid City. William is a technically-minded man, fully devoted to the Assassins and their cause, whose passion for politics outweighs his responsibility to his family. While William’s wife has always been able to deal with this emotional distance, young Desmond could not. Eventually he grew to feel that his father was more of a drill sergeant than a parent and fled the compound, despite his parents’ repeated warnings to never leave.

Id: [0x0006D5C9]
!*1.1.5       Dr. Warren Vidic

Id: [0x0006D5CA]
!*Dr. Warren Vidic is the head of genetic research at Abstergo Industries, where he leads the Animus Project.  One of the world’s leading authorities on genetic memory, Vidic has dedicated most of his life to the subject. It is in great part because of his theories that the Animus device was created, with Vidic leading the initiative from the onset.

Id: [0x0006D5CB]
!*1.1.6       Daniel Cross

Id: [0x0006D5CC]
!*Daniel Cross (born 1974) was a late 20th century descendent of the Russian Assassin Nikolai Orelov. Plagued by hallucinations of his ancestor’s memories, he became a criminal, as well as a drug addict and alcoholic. Daniel was instrumental in the assassination of the leading member of the modern-day Assassins known as "The Mentor", and the near-destruction of the Brotherhood in 2000.

Id: [0x0006D5CD]
!*Abstergo Industries kidnapped Daniel at an early age. Under the designation Subject 4, his genetic memory was explored and his mind experimented upon by Warren Vidic. The latter implanted Daniel with a false identity and, most importantly, a single impulse: to locate the Mentor, and kill him.

Id: [0x0006D5D1]
!*2.1       Animus Controls

Id: [0x0006D5D2]
!*Hello Desmond. The Animus allows you to control your ancestor Connor through a combination of standard and contextual buttons. Standard buttons always perform the same action. For example, holding [RB] always activates the Weapon Wheel. On the other hand, Contextual buttons change depending on the context that Connor is currently in. For example, pressing [B] can make Connor open doors, examine a clue, or take the wheel of a boat, depending on the context.

Id: [0x0006D5D3]
!*2.2       General Actions

Id: [0x0006D5D4]
!*2.2.1       Move

Id: [0x0006D5D5]
!*Move using [LS]. Up or down moves Edward forward or backward. Left or right makes him turn to the left or to the right. Press and hold [A] to walk quickly; you will also gently push people out of your way while holding [A].

Id: [0x0006D5D6]
!*2.2.2       Look

Id: [0x0006D5D7]
!*Use [RS] to look around the environment. Pressing [RSpress] re-centers the camera.

Id: [0x0006D5D8]
!*2.2.3       High & Low Profile Concept

Id: [0x0006D5D9]
!*It is possible to change the intensity of Connor's actions. By default, your ancestor will be in Low Profile, but his state can be changed to High Profile by pressing and holding [RT].

Id: [0x0006D5DA]
!*This is like stepping on the gas! In Low Profile, Connor’s actions are inconspicuous and more socially acceptable. Fast and powerful assassin moves such as freerunning or tackling are available in High Profile.

Id: [0x0006D5DB]
!*2.2.4       Targeting and Lock On

Id: [0x0006D5DC]
!*We’ve upgraded the targeting and locking system to make things a little easier for you in the Animus. As you move around in the environment, you’ll notice that only some characters are highlighted; these characters are your ranged targets. By default, only enemy and military targets are highlighted. When you hold [LT], Precision Mode is activated, which allows you to target any character at will. Simply move the crosshairs over the character you want to target and they will become highlighted. If you press [LT] while you have a character highlighted, you will lock on to that character and the camera will follow them.

Id: [0x0006D5DD]
!*2.2.5       Weapons

Id: [0x0006D5DE]
!*Pressing [X] will use your currently equipped melee weapon. Note that you can only target military and enemy targets by default; you have to use Precision Mode (see "Target and Lock On" for details) to select civilian targets. Your melee target has a stronger visual highlight than the ranged target.

Id: [0x0006D5DF]
!*You can prepare an attack by holding [X] as you run toward an enemy. When you are in range, the attack will automatically be triggered. You can use this technique to do fluid, continuous attacks without stopping.

Id: [0x0006D5E0]
!*If you select the hidden blades as your melee weapon, you will be able to assassinate 2 targets at the same time if they are in range. Additionally, the hidden blades have a stealth kill available: if you are in Low Profile attacking a target will make Connor perform a stealth kill which allows you to escape the scene before anyone notices what happened. If you are in High Profile (holding [RT]) your kill will be overt and witnessed.

Id: [0x0006D5E1]
!*2.2.6       Tools

Id: [0x0006D5E2]
!*Pressing [Y] will use your currently selected tool. Some tools, such as trip mines, require you to hold [Y] to deploy them. Weapons such as muskets or pistols will fire every time you press [Y] as long as there is a bullet loaded in the weapon, otherwise it will reload the weapon. If you want to reload a double barreled pistol after only one shot, you can press [RB] to reload.

Id: [0x0006D5E3]
!*Some weapons, such as muskets, have two functions. If you press [X] you will use the musket as a melee weapon; if you press [Y] you will shoot the musket. If a weapon has two functions it will override both your melee and tool icons in the HUD.

Id: [0x0006D5E4]
!*2.2.7       Contextual Actions

Id: [0x0006D5E5]
!*All of the contextual interactions are on the [B] button. Interactive objects have a highlight, and when you approach them you’ll see the interaction either in the world or in the HUD. Press [B] to activate the interaction. Contextual actions include starting missions, opening doors, picking up weapons, picking pockets, and so on. If the action requires time to complete (such as looting a body or picking a pocket) you will see a radial display on screen that indicates how long it will take to complete the action. Keep holding [B] until it fills completely.

You can also pick pockets by holding [B] while in low profile.<br><br>Pressing [X] with a nearby enemy highlighted uses your currently selected melee weapon.<br><br>Pressing [Y] uses your currently selected tool. Note that ranged weapons require a highlighted target to use them.

!*Hold [RT]: Hold the High Profile button to make your ancestor sprint and perform freerunning.<br><br>Holding this button down makes Connor automatically adapt to any object in the path. Just push [LS] in the direction you want him to go. You no longer have to hold the [A] button to freerun!<br><br>While you are freerunning, you will only take “safe” jumps. If you want to jump off of where you are with no regard for safety, you can press [A].

Id: [0x0006DC78]
!*Also, if you are using [RT] to freerunning through trees and there is a choice between going forward and going up, Connor will move forward by default. You can hold [A] to make Connor jump up higher in the trees. <br><br>If there is a low object such as a small fence in front of Connor, [RT] will first make Connor jump on top of the fence and then continue moving in whatever direction you are pressing. If you want to make Connor pass smoothly over the small object, hold [A] while you approach it.<br> <br>While holding [RT] you will also automatically pass under objects that have small openings underneath them.

Id: [0x0006DC7B]
!*Enemies that are attacking you have a small red sign above their head.

Id: [0x0006DC7C]
!*Certain enemies are not vulnerable to your normal attacks. You must use a different strategy to defeat them.<br> <br>If an enemy has a yellow sign above their head, they are going to perform a special attack - such as shoot a gun, throw a grenade, or perform a heavy attack. These attacks cannot be blocked.<br><br>Grenades and Heavy Attacks must be dodged or avoided. To defend yourself against a gunshot, move close to another enemy and press [A] to use them as a human shield.

!*The more notorious you are, the more guards will pay attention to you. <br><br>At the first level of Notoriety, guards are vaguely aware of you. They will slowly notice your presence if you are not blended, and will then investigate you before entering conflict. <br><br>At the second level of Notoriety, guards are aware of your presence and will investigate you on sight.<br> <br>At the third level of Notoriety, guards will enter conflict with you on sight, and certain high-level guards will search for you in the crowd. There will also be more guards will be present in the city overall. <br><br>Note: Because being on rooftops is forbidden, snipers will always detect anyone on sight.<br><br>Enemies in military zones (red zones on the map) are more alert and will pay more attention to you if they see you; even if you are not notorious they will be interested in your presence.

Each act performed with the intention of ensuring control.<br><br>Once they had established themselves in positions of power, they turned their attention towards the Brotherhood. <br><br>The Assassins were hunted to the last - until Achilles only remained. Connor pressed him - but the old man would not say why he was spared. <br><br>He spoke instead of Haytham - explaining that it was Connor's own father who now led the Order; who bore responsibility for the Brotherhood's destruction. He detailed the man's crimes - each more devious than the last. <br><br>Connor bore the news in quiet contemplation - asking questions when he was uncertain - and offering his own insight into what it was his father and the Templars sought.<br><br>Achilles watched him - not knowing whether Connor fullly understood the implications of his tale.

Id: [0x0006FD41]
!*Yes, I’ll admit, this is a puzzling addition to our little costume drama. On this spot, at this point in 1715, we should probably be looking at a few small buildings rising from a recently drained swamp, or a smaller and less impressive Cathedral at the very least – the one which occupied this location in the 1720s. But this small-scale, new-world masterpiece is just too lovely to leave out of our Abstergo Ultimate Pirate Experience (final title TBD). <br>Because that’s what we’re committed to here at Abstergo Entertainment: Absolute Beauty before Literal Truth. It’s our decree. Forget John Keats and his silly odes. Truth is Beauty? Beauty is Truth? Not when you have 10 million units to push. People want to see landmarks, so we’re going to give them landmarks.<br>But as far as the facts go, this is what I know. Construction of the Cathedral blah blah blah de la Habana was started in 1748 and finished in 1777. A mesmerizing example of Baroque aesthetics, the building`s obvious asymmetry and curious construction material – coral taken from the ocean nearby – make this one of the most unique houses of worship in the world.

My job is to research the life of the pirate, Edward Kenwway, and find promising footage for use in future Abstergo products.<br><br>Sample 17 executive producer, Melanie Lemay, is a passionate and energetic leader. And the company's CCO, Olivier Garneau, seems like a fun guy. I can't wait to settle in and get to work...

!*work diary - week 2<br><br>Talked to Melanie Lemay about rewards and bonuses.<br><br>Visited Olivier Garneau in his office. He asked me to prioritize Edward's search for something called The Observatory.<br><br>Was contacted by "John from I.T." He asked me to access a colleague's computer and recover a video file for him.<br><br>I delivered this video file (a strange autopsy video) to a courrier named Rebecca in the lobby.<br><br>I also noticed the barista here is a bit of a dandy... a bit annoying.<br><br>So far, so good. A really productive week!

Id: [0x0007E449]
!*work diary - week 3<br><br>An unsettling week, to say the least! I logged out and received a message to meet Melanie near the elevator. Together we rode the elevator to Olivier's office, but he barred me from the meeting at the last minute.<br><br>While waiting, John contacted me again. He asked me to help him recalibrate some security cameras. This resulted in me spying on Olivier's meeting with Melanie by accident. They were on the phone with a woman named Laetitia – an Abstergo Entertainment executive by the sound of it.<br><br>Laetitia demanded that they intensify their search for the Observatory. Melanie tried to reassure her that this was happening. Olivier tried to contain his anger. But John, listening in, was ecstatic. The call concluded with a mention of a shareholders meeting in Chicago.<br><br>This is where things got weird: John erupted in a fit of rage and demanded that I break into Olivier's office to steal the shareholder's meeting schedule, threatening to expose me for hacking computers and camera systems if I did not. Having no other options, I sneaked into Olivier's office via the terrace, hacked his computer, and recovered the meeting schedule.<br><br>John ranted about Templars, claiming they "own Abstergo" and another group. He appears to be mentally ill.<br><br>Once again, I delivered the schedule to the woman, Rebecca, who appears to be more than a simple courier.<br><br>John seemed to calm down after this. He said I was free to return to work. I'm scared.

Id: [0x0007E44D]
!*work diary - week 4<br><br>When I logged out of my ANIMUS session, I discovered that I was no longer in my cubicle. Someone had transported me, while I was in the ANIMUS and vulnerable to a different location.<br><br>Melanie's face appeared on a nearby screen, and she told me I was in some sort of containment facility with some of my other colleagues. They were conducting an internal investigation and had moved us here to keep an eye on. And for our own safety, supposedly. She seemed sympathetic, and advised me to keep up hope and try to get some work done.<br><br>Almost immediately after she logged off, John called. He was unperturbed by my predicament, but at least promised to help me clear my name. He unlocked the doors to my cell and sent me to sneak into the server room for the entire building. Melanie was in there for some reason, but John managed to get her out of the way.<br><br>The moment I hacked the server, an apparition appeared in front of me. She kept talking about it being too early, while at the same time, John kept losing his cool over the communicator. When she left, John left little doubt about what he had expected to happen here - he wanted this apparition to possess my body and was audibly enraged when that didn't happen.<br><br>In the end, I tried to seek refuge in my work. Perhaps Edward's memories and the secrets within could bring clarity to my present predicament.

Id: [0x0007E44F]
!*work diary - week 5<br><br>John tried to kill me. I awoke with him looming over me like an old snake. He looked oddly familiar at first, and when he spoke, I knew why right away: he was the spitting image of Bartholomew Roberts. He ranted for a time about his Beloved – the specter from the server room I assume – and about how he was a reborn figure of some sort. Before he could elaborate further, however, Abstergo security guards were upon him. John resisted and they shot him dead.<br><br>Melanie apologized profusely for my detainment, and thanked me for my work. I think I believe her. She has always struck me as sincere...<br><br>Shaken by the whole experience, I wanted only to go home... but I was soon contacted by the courier and the barista from a few weeks earlier. My instincts about them proved correct. They seem to belong to this "Assassin" collective, and they encouraged me to continue hacking Abstergo's servers. With the security level I have now, it is doubtful I will ever be caught again. Not any time soon anyway. I'm not sure what to do next... quit my job? Or press forward. There is still so much work to do...

!*use [LS] to control your data

Id: [0x0007EBFF]
!*You need to transfer the data from the starting point on the left to the finishing position on the right.

Sequences

Id: [0x0007EC01]
!*The security programs in the data streams will destroy your data if they touch it.

Id: [0x0007EC02]
!*When the game area edges become active they turn red. Active edges destroy the player data.

Id: [0x0007EC03]
!*When data is destroyed it is returned to its starting position.

Id: [0x0007EC04]
!*Moving data streams move in one direction - up or down. Upon entering a moving data stream your data will start to move with the stream.

Id: [0x0007EC05]
!*Secured space is a part of the data stream that you cannot go through. If your data touches a secured space, it will be destroyed.

Id: [0x0007EC06]
!*These security programs change states - they go from inactive to active. When they are in active state they will destroy your data. When they are in inactive state you can move over them.

Id: [0x0007EC07]
!*navigate between numbers using Left and Right on [LS]

Id: [0x0007EC08]
!*change the values using Left and Right on the [RS]

Id: [0x0007EC09]
!*The goal of this hack is to find prime numbers which - when multiplied together - will result in a number matching the target number of the puzzle.

Id: [0x0007EC0A]
!*Each number also corresponds to a wave with a specific frequency.

Id: [0x0007EC0B]
!*The target wave is created from the total of all frequencies corresponding to the target prime numbers

Id: [0x0007EC0C]
!*You can use both the target number and the target wave to help you solve the puzzle.

Id: [0x0007EC0D]
!*[LS] - Move data [RS] - Rotate sphere

Id: [0x0007EC0E]
!*Get the data moving in an infinite loop around the sphere.

Id: [0x0007EC0F]
!*Once your data moves in a specific direction it will continue moving until it reaches an obstacle.

!*Chapter Three<br><br>She was in The Auld Shillelagh, a tavern halfway between Hatherton and Bristol, a regular haunt of mine, and sometimes, in the summer when mother and father toiled over the shearing at home, when I’d have to make more regular trips into town, then several times a day.<br><br>I admit I hadn’t taken much notice of her at first, which is unusual for me, because I liked to pride myself on knowing the exact location of any pretty woman nearabouts, and besides, the Shillelagh wasn’t exactly the sort of place you expected to find a pretty woman. A woman, yes. A certain type of woman. But this girl I could see wasn’t like that: she was young, about my age, and she wore a white linen coif and a smock. Looked to me like a domestic. <br><br>But what made me aware of her wasn’t her clothes, it was the loudness of her voice, which was quite in contrast to the way she looked. She was sitting with three men, all of them older than her, who I recognized at once: Tom Cobleigh, his brother Seth, and Julian somebody, whose surname escaped me, but who worked with them: three men with whom I had traded words if not blows before; the kind who looked down their noses at me because they thought I looked down my nose at them; who liked me no more than I liked them, which was not a lot. They were sat forward on their stools and watching this young girl with leering, wolfish eyes that betrayed a darker purpose, even though they were all smiles, banging on the table, encouraging her as she drank dry a flagon of ale.<br><br>No, she did not look like one of the women who usually frequented the tavern, but it seemed that she was determined to act like one of them. The flagon was about as big as she was, and as she wiped her hand across her mouth and banged it to the table, the men responded with cheers, shouting for another one and no doubt pleased to see her wobble slightly on her stool. Probably couldn’t believe their luck. Pretty little thing like that.<br><br>I watched as they let the girl drink yet more ale with the same tumult accompanying her success, and then as she did the same as before, and wiped her hand across her mouth, but with an even more pronounced wobble this time, a look passed between them. A look that seemed to say, ‘The Job Is Done.’ <br><br>Tom and Julian stood, and they began, in their words, to ‘escort’ her to the door, because, ‘You’ve had too much to drink, my lovely, let’s get you home, shall we?’<br><br>‘To bed,’ smirked Seth, thinking he was saying it under his breath even though the whole tavern heard him. ‘Let’s be getting you to bed.’<br><br> I passed a look to the barman, who dropped his eyes and used his apron to blow his nose. A customer sat down the bar from me turned away as I appealed to him with my eyes, <br><br>Bastards. Might as well have looked to the cat for help, I thought, then with a sigh banged down my tankard, stepped off my stool and followed the Cobleighs into the road outside.<br><br>I blinked as I stepped from the darkness of the tavern into bright sunlight. My cart was there, roasting in the sun; beside it another one that I took to belong to the Cobleighs. On the other side of the road was a yard with house set far back, but no sign of a farmer. We were alone on the highway: just me, the two Cobleigh brothers, Julian, and the girl, of course.<br><br>‘Well, Tom Cobleigh,’ I said, ‘the things you see on a fine afternoon. Why, just you and your cronies are getting drunk and getting a poor defenseless young woman even drunker.’<br><br>The girl sagged as Tom Cobleigh let go her arm and turned to address me, his finger already raised. <br><br>‘Now just you stay out of this, Edward Kenway, you young good-for-nothing. You’re as drunk as I am and yer morals just as loose, I don’t need to be given a talking-to by the likes of you.’<br><br>Seth and Julian had turned as well. The girl was glazed over, like her mind had turned in for the night even if her body was still awake.<br><br>‘Well,’ I smiled, ‘loose morals I might have, Tom Cobleigh, but I don’t need to pour ale down a girl’s throat before taking her to bed, and I certainly don’t need two friends to help me at the task.’<br><br>Tom Cobleigh reddened. ‘Why, you cheeky little bastard, you, I’m going to put her on my cart is what I’m going to do, and take her home.<br><br>‘I have no doubt that you intend to put on your cart and take her home. It’s what you plan to do between putting her on the cart and reaching home that concerns me.’<br><br>‘That concerns you, does it? A broken nose and a couple of broken ribs will be concerning you unless you mind your own bloody business.’<br><br>Squinting, I glanced at the highway, where trees bordering the dirt track shone gold and green in the sun, and in the distance was a lone figure on a horse, shimmering and indistinct.<br><br>I took a step forward, and if there had been any warmth or humor in my manner, then it disappeared now, almost of its own accord. There was a steeliness in my voice when I next spoke. <br><br>‘Now you just leave that girl alone, Tom Cobleigh, or I won’t be responsible for my actions.’ <br><br>The three men looked at one another. In a way they’d done as I asked. They’d let go of the girl, and she seemed almost relieved to slide to her haunches, placing one hand on the ground and looking at us all with bleary eyes. Evidently oblivious to all that was being discussed on her behalf.<br><br>Meanwhile I looked at the Cobleighs and weighed up the odds. Had I ever fought three at once? Well, no. Because if you were fighting three at once then you weren’t so much fighting, you were getting beaten up, but come on, Edward Kenway, I told myself. Yes, on the one hand it was three men, but one of them was Tom Cobleigh, who was no spring chicken, about my father’s age. Another one was Seth Cobleigh, who was Tom Cobleigh’s son. And if you can imagine the kind of person who would help his father get a young girl drunk, well, then you can imagine that sort of person Seth Cobleigh was, which was to say a maggoty, underhand type, more likely to run away from a fight with wet breeches than stand his ground. And what’s more, they were drunk.<br><br>On the other hand I was drunk too. Plus they had Julian who, going on looks alone, which is all I had, could handle himself. <br><br>But I had another idea. That lone rider I could see in the distance. If I could just hold off the Cobleighs till he arrived, the odds were likely to shift back in my favor. After all, if he was of good character, the lone rider was bound to stop and help me out.<br><br>‘Well, Tom Cobleigh,’ I said, ‘you got the advantage over me, that’s obvious for anyone to see, but, you know, I just wouldn’t be able to look my mother in the eye knowing I’d let you and your cronies abduct this pretty young thing.’<br><br>I glanced up the road, to where that lone rider was getting closer. Come on then, I thought. Don’t hang about. <br><br>‘So,’ I continued, ‘even if you end up leaving me in a bloody heap by the side of this here road, and carry that young lassie off anyway, I’m going to have to do all that I can to make it as difficult for you as possible. And perhaps see to it that you go on your way with a black eye and maybe a pair of throbbing bollocks for your troubles.’<br><br>Tom Cobleigh spat then gazed at me through wizened, slitty eyes. ‘Well are you just going to stand there talking about it all day, Edward Kenway, or are you going to attend to your task? Because time waits for no man…’ he grinned an evil grin. ‘I’ve got people to see, things to do.’<br><br>‘Aye, that’s right, and the longer you leave it the more chance that poor Lassie has of sobering up, eh?’<br><br>‘I don’t mind telling you, I’m getting tired of all this talk, Kenway,’ he turned to Julian. ‘How about we teach this little bastard a lesson? Oh, and one more thing before we start, Master Kenway, you ain’t fit to shine your mother’s shoes, you understand?’<br><br>That hit me hard, I don’t mind admitting. Having someone like Tom Cobleigh, who had all the morals of a frothing dog and about half the intelligence, able to reach into my soul and, if my guilt was an open wound, then stick his thumb in that open wound and cause me even more pain, well, it certainly firmed up my resolve, if nothing else.<br><br>Julian pushed his chest forward and with a snarl advanced. Two steps away from me he raised his fists, dipped his right shoulder and swung, and I don’t know who Julian was used to fighting outside taverns, but somebody with less experience than me, that’s for sure, because I’d already taken note of the fact that he was right-handed, and he couldn’t have made his intentions more obvious if he’d tried. <br><br>The dirt rose in clouds around my feet as I dodged easily and brought my own right up sharply. He shouted in pain as I caught him under the jaw. And if it had just been him, the battle would have been won. But Tom Cobleigh was already upon me. I just saw him out of the corner of my eye and was too late to react and I was dazed by a fist that slammed into my temple. <br><br>I staggered slightly as I turned to meet the attack, and my fists were swinging much more wildly than I’d have liked. I was hoping to land a lucky blow, needing to put at least one of the men down to even up the numbers, but none of my punches made contact as Tom Cobleigh retreated, plus Julian had recovered from my first punch with alarming speed and now came at me again. <br><br>He swung and his right hand connected with my chin, spinning me about so that I almost lost my balance. My hat fell off, my hair was in my eyes and I was in disarray. And guess who came in with his boots kicking? That worm Seth Cobleigh, shouting encouragement to his father and Julian at the same time. And the little bastard was lucky. His boot caught me in the midriff and, already off-balance, I lost my footing. And fell.<br><br>The worst thing you can do in a fight against three men is fall. Once you fall it’s over. Through their legs I saw the lone rider up the highway, now my only chance at salvation, possibly my only hope of getting out of this alive, but what I saw made my heart sink. Not a man on a horse, a tradesmen, who would dismount and come rushing to my aid. No, the lone rider was a woman. She was riding astride the horse, not sidesaddle, but even though was lady. She wore a bonnet and a light-colored summery dress, and the last thing I thought before the Cobleigh boots obscured my view and the kicks came raining in, was that she was beautiful.<br><br>But beauty wasn’t going to save me now.<br><br>‘Hey,’ I heard. ‘You three men. Stop what you’re doing right now.’<br><br>They turned to look up at her and removed their hats, shuffling in line to hide the sight of me, who lay coughing on the ground.<br><br>‘What is going on here?’ she demanded to know. From the sound of her voice I could tell she was young and while not highly born, definitely well-bred – too well-bred, surely, to be riding unaccompanied?<br><br>‘We were just teaching this young man here some manners,’ rasped Tom Cobleigh, out of breath. Exhausting business, it was, kicking me half to death.<br><br>‘Well it doesn’t take three of you to do that, does it?’ she replied. I could see her now, twice as beautiful as I’d first thought as she glowered at the Cobleighs, who for their part looked thoroughly mollified.<br><br>She dismounted. ‘More to the point, what you doing with this young lady here?’ pointing at the girl, who still sat dazed and drunk on the ground.<br><br>‘Oh, ma’am, this is a young friend of ours who has had too much to drink.’<br><br>The lady darkened. ‘She is most certainly not your young friend, she is a maidservant, and if I don’t get her back home before my mother discovers that she’s absconded then she will be an unemployed maidservant.’ <br><br>She looked pointedly from one man to the next. ‘I know you men, and I think I know exactly what has been going on here. Now, you will leave this young man alone and be on your way before I am of a mind to take this further.’<br><br>With much bowing and scraping, the Cobleighs clambered aboard their cart and were soon gone. Meanwhile the woman dismounted and knelt down to speak to me. ‘My name is Caroline Scott, my family lives on Hawkins Lane in Bristol, let me take you back there and tend to your wounds.’<br><br>‘I cannot, my lady,’ I said, sitting up and trying to manage a grin. ‘I have work to do.’ <br><br>She stood. ‘I see. And did I assess the situation correctly?’<br><br>I picked up my hat and began to brush the dirt from it. It was even more battered now. ‘You did, my lady.’<br><br>‘Then I owe you my thanks and so will Rose when she sobers up. She’s a willful girl, not always the easiest of staff, but nevertheless, I don’t want to see her suffer for her impetuousness.’<br><br>She was an angel, I decided then, and as I helped them mount the horse, Caroline holding onto Rose, who lolled drunkenly over the neck of the horse, I had a sudden thought.<br><br>‘Can I see you again, my lady? To thank you properly when my when I look a little more presentable, perhaps?’<br><br>She gave me a regretful look. ‘I fear my father would not approve,’ she said, and with that shook the reins and left.<br><br>That night I sat beneath the thatch of our cottage, staring out over the pastures as the sun went down. Usually my thoughts would concern either the possibility of escape or wrestling with the inevitability of my future. <br><br>That night I thought of Caroline. Caroline Scott of Hawkins Lane.

!*CHAT ARCHIVE: EVERYBODY'S WORKING ON THE WEEKEND<br><br>Olivier: I need your guys to get me everything on the observatory by the end of Friday at the latest. Can you do it?<br> <br>Mel:  No! Are you crazy? We don’t even know where it is yet. And Friday’s a holiday.<br> <br>Olivier:  A holiday? Really? Do your people realize that working here is a privilege? If they care about their jobs, they’ll come in, and it will be an honor.<br> <br>Olivier:  And no, I’m not crazy. I’m getting a lot of heat from Laetitia. If we don’t get it done, she’ll take it out on Devils and ALL our work will be lost.<br> <br>Mel:  Ugh. Does she even know  how anything works here?<br> <br>Olivier:  She has her own pressures.<br> <br>Mel:  I realize that, but we’re already working overtime. <br> <br>Mel:  And when are we going to discuss how the plot of Devils has to change to accommodate this observatory business? How am I going to sell this? <br> <br>Olivier: You’re not going to. It’s too sensitive.<br> <br>Mel:  So we’re just collecting the memories for NO REASON?<br> <br>Olivier: Not for no reason. Laetitia will use them.<br> <br>Mel: This is ridiculous. You want us to devote our lives to finding information we’re not allowed to develop, or understand, or use in any way. It won’t help sales, and my people will never see their work rewarded in public. How am I supposed to motivate them?<br> <br>Olivier: I don’t know. Get them breakfast. Pain au chocolat. Coffee. Pretend to “sneak in” some coffee liqueur. A little beer with lunch. Feed them. They’ll forgive you.<br> <br>Mel: Again? They’re not going to keep falling for this.<br> <br>Olivier: Yes they will. Bread and circuses. Look it up. It’s a thing.<br> <br>Mel: Come on. Be serious.<br> <br>Olivier: I am being serious. Remember: none of this comes from me. Laetitia needs what she needs. If you want the project to continue, we have to keep her happy.<br> <br>Olivier: The Observatory doesn’t have anything to do with pirates anyway. It would only complicate things. Take the focus off the action. <br> <br>Mel: But it’s fascinating. I realize it’s more mature and complex (I can’t believe I’m the one arguing this…) but we are CRAZY not to use it.<br> <br>Mel: Imagine: we could be selling to pirate fans AND conspiracy theorists all at the same time. The potential for market growth is HUGE.<br> <br>Olivier: We cannot use it, so please stop asking.<br> <br>Mel: This is insane.<br> <br>Olivier: As you already know, Melanie, this company is a subsidiary of Abstergo Industries, and Abstergo Industries has a different culture. They are hierarchical and rule driven. We may not always like it, but if we want to advance in this company, we have to be careful.  <br> <br>Mel: You’re protecting her.<br> <br>Olivier: I’m protecting *you.* I know we have our arguments from time to time, but I know you care deeply about our work, and I don’t want you to get yourself ejected from the conversation. We need you.<br> <br>Olivier: Do you understand?<br>Mel: Yeah, I get it. “Pick my battles.” It’s common sense. I don’t know why this one thing is bothering me so much right now. I’m just tired.<br> <br>Olivier: So I don’t need to find someone else to help me?<br> <br>Mel: No. We’ll get it done. Somehow.<br> <br>Olivier: I will personally bring the coffee liqueur for breakfast.<br> <br>Mel: Lol. Thanks. I’ll find some way to get them excited about it in the meantime.<br><br>Olivier: If it makes you feel better, I can tell you a secret…<br><br>Mel: What?! :-D<br><br>Olivier: If we are successful with the Observatory, Abstergo may develop a Las Vegas attraction to accompany the release of Devils.<br><br>Mel: WHAT-WHAT???!!!<br><br>Olivier: They’re looking into a partnership with those aquatic circus people you like. Imagine celebrating with the whole team, at a live-action gladiator show-- Assassins vs. Templars vs. Pirates vs. Sharks.<br><br>Mel: Whoa. I am in awe. How do you come up with this stuff?<br><br>Olivier: Oh, I have all kinds of little things saved in files here and there. I always think I’ll get around to doing something with them in a quiet moment<br><br>Mel: But there are never quiet moments.<br><br>Mel: Oh well, you’ll retire some day.<br><br>Olivier: Not if I’m lucky.<br><br>Mel: Me neither ;-)

!*Antikythera Mechanism<br><br>Originally assumed to be an analog computing device built for the purposes of determining the future positions of astral bodies, Abstergo Industries scientists have recently discovered that the Antyktheria mechanism is merely one small portion of a much larger tool: a so-called “prognostication machine” thought to have been used by the First Civilization to make probability-based predictions of future events. It has been confirmed, for instance, that our precursor race used such a device in conjunction with their inherent precognitive abilities to locate and contact Mr. Desmond Miles, the source of the Sample 17 strand, for purposes that shall remain classified. It is also known that, due to the nature of these “quantum probability measurements,” that such machines would have been exceedingly difficult to use, and that many hundreds or thousands of trials would have been needed to “peek” such great distances into the future.

!*To: Melanie Lemay; Kama Neron; Kloé Lesney; Christopher Darby; Evan Dean<br>From: Olivier Garneau<br>Date: 6 nov 2013 09:46<br><br>Salut!<br><br>As most of you know, I’ll be attending the Chicago shareholders meeting from the 15th to the 17th, and they’ll want to see our progress with the Kenway line. The small amount of data we have already gathered is incredible, and we anticipate even more amazing finds in the near future. The events and people we have seen so far make us confident that the complete experience will be one of the most eye-opening explorations of piracy ever seen. It will take quite a bit of work to scrub the data of objectionable and classified material, but we already have some incredibly promising footage.<br><br>At the same time, Abstergo Entertainment will soon be announcing a closed beta for our new “consumer cloud-interface app” (sexy name forthcoming). Edward Kenway’s “virtual pirate experience” will be the first complete product on offer, and the first of its kind anywhere: an immersive, interactive pirate experience drawn from actual historical data. Internal tests of our consumer cloud app have been encouraging, and we anticipate it will be ready in time for the next holiday season if everything goes according to plan.<br><br>So this leads us to a broader question: what other experiences would we like to offer? What other historical periods and locations can we explore? Judging by our current rate of data retrieval, our capacity to produce, and our understanding of consumption trends… executives at Abstergo Industries have given me the goal of producing one complete virtual experience per annum, in addition to smaller offerings… as our research allows (this includes books, recordings, films, and any other trans-media offerings).<br><br>A second, related question is this: does Sample 17 contain enough compelling data to sustain our current commitment to it, or should we make a request to Abstergo Industries for additional archived data… remember that data from Sample 1 proved fruitful enough to create our “Liberation” product. It is very likely that research into Samples 2 through 16 would bear surprising fruits as well.<br><br>Thoughts?<br>_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _<br>Olivier Garneau <br>Chief Creative Officer<br>Abstergo Entertainment<br>

Just a brief heads-up with where we stand now:<br><br>I’ve been the Sample 17 project director for just over a year now, and my team and I have been able to cobble together a rough list of the most interesting time periods available to us through this single genetic sample. Remember this is data that has already been FULLY or PARTIALLY sequenced by Abstergo Industries. I’ll try to be brief… <br><br>Patrilineal Line:<br>Fifteenth Century – Italian Renaissance<br>Sixteenth Century – Ottoman Empire<br>Eighteenth Century – American Colonies / War for Independence.<br>Nineteenth Century – New England and American Midwest. <br><br>Matrilineal Line:<br>Twelfth Century - Holy Land / Crusades<br>Thirteenth century – Egypt and Northern Africa<br>Fourteenth Century – Ashikaga Shogunate in Japan<br>Eighteenth Century – French Revolution<br>Nineteenth Century – Napoleonic wars; Taiwan<br>Twentieth Century – “Summer of Love” American Pacific Coast<br><br>Obviously this is just a small sample of the potential options. The number of ancestors any one person has is well above thirty-thousand after just fifteen generations… so there could be many more surprises waiting for us within Sample 17.<br><br>However, despite Sample 17s rich heritage, we should not limit ourselves to this alone if we have concrete leads elsewhere. For instance, quite a few men from all sides of my family fought in both World Wars, and I even have a great-great-grandfather who fought in the American Civil War. Managed to meet President Lincoln a few times too. Going this route is a little more costly and time consuming, since the data has not already been sequenced. But it could be rewarding in the long-run.<br><br>In short, if anyone has any confirmed connections to interesting historical events, periods, or cities – or knows of people who do – please share! I will also be reviewing the past 3 decades of samples collected and sequenced by Abstergo industries. I recently learned that one of their Samples – number 2, I believe – participated in the trial of Jeanne D’Arc. So there’s a nice lead right here.<br><br>MEL<br><br>*Melany Lemay * Project Coordinator * Sample 17<br><Quoted Text Hidden>

So, as tempting as a “Jeanne D’Arc experience” sounds, I’m not sure Abstergo Industries would be too keen on letting us rummage around in Dr. Vidic’s DNA. It’s just a sensitive topic.<br><br>For my own part: I’m related to François-Xavier Garneau, noted Quebecois historian and Poet. Exciting right? A possible lead? ;)<br><br>One additional caveat: Let’s avoid digging into any modern periods (i.e. 20th century) unless we find something incredibly compelling. Because, as fun as a World War Two setting might sound, we’d do well to avoid any settings with vehicles: cars, motorcycles, helicopters, tanks, etc. <br><br>Why? you may ask. Because our research has shown that “memory imprinting” in individuals is actually hampered by the semi-catatonic state most people enter when driving for medium and long periods of time… and this makes data retrieval somewhat more difficult. In short, we don’t want to go through the effort of coding extra Animus features just for the sake of digging up memories of people driving around in cars. There are other and more efficient ways to experience that…<br><br>OG<br><br><Quoted Text Hidden>

Quebec City IS beautiful. But without Pirates, Ninjas, or Zombies, I’m not sure how well a story about a historian would sell. :)<br><br>Also keep in mind: Samples 4 and 16 might be off limits too. While doing my own research last month, I caught wind of some exciting characters buried in these gene samples. But as soon as I started digging, I was told by people far, far above me to stop. Very odd, but not surprising I suppose. AE has a lot of active military contracts, and I assume these had something to do with that. I didn’t push back.<br><br>As far as my own If anyone is interested, my great-grandfather was friends with Hemmingway and Stein and Satie and Picasso when he lived in Paris in the 1920s.

!*Memory Seals<br><br>These devices – powerful in function but limited in scope – were used by the precursor First Civilization to record brief memory impressions, which could then be played back or re-experienced by another user at a later date. Judging by their scarcity – fewer than 40 have ever been found or accounted for – it appears that these seals were not wielded casually by the precursor race, but were intended for use only by the wealthiest and most powerful members of that society. To date, no seals containing recorded precursor memories have been found, and only a few have been known to contain any information whatsoever. The seals used by the Assassin Altaïr Ibn La-Ahad to pass memory information to Ezio Auditore da Firenze are suspected to be functional to this day, but as of this writing, their whereabouts are unknown. As a point of interest, it can be revealed that many of Abstergo’s early breakthroughs in genetic memory technology came about through close study of these artifacts, although current Animus technology is NOT based on their architecture.

!*Voynich Manuscript<br><br>A fascinating puzzle as yet unsolved, we are deeply interested in finding the person or persons responsible for the creation of this magnificent and mystifying tome. All researchers assigned to European subjects living in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries should be advised to pay special heed to any mention of this rare and valuable artifact. Though recent carbon dating has given the manuscript a birth-date of 1405 or thereabouts, Abstergo Industries has uncovered highly classified information that complicates this theory greatly. One subject of great interest to us in this endeavor is the English Philosopher, Roger Bacon.

!*Baghdad Battery<br><br>A mystery that has puzzled scientists for decades, the Baghdad battery’s ultimate secret has finally been discovered. This year, researchers at Abstergo Industries determined that these batteries contained, at one time, a synthetic precursor element capable of producing power by harnessing energy generated by the passage of time. Eerily similar to what theoretical physicists have called “Time Crystals”, this unknown crystalline material was able to generate tiny but unlimited levels of energy simply by siphoning energy from the passage of time itself. Though minute, the resulting power was likely enough to power a small LED… resulting in a humble but incredibly efficient means of producing light. To date, a functioning precursor “Time Crystal” has not been located.

!*Crystal Skulls<br><br>These ancient tools have been found on a few separate occasions, at alleged precursor sites throughout the world. All are communication devices to some degree, although three distinct varieties have been discovered so far. The first crystal skulls worked much like the mobile-telephony devices we use today; these allowed multi-node communication between all who possessed a working device. A second crystal skull was later discovered to have a record-and-playback function, meaning a user could record and send audio-visual messages to multiple parties, as frequently as he saw fit. A third set of crystal skulls discovered only recently seem to have acted as passive “monitoring devices,” much like televisions in a multi-camera surveillance system set up. As yet, the cameras on the opposite end of this set-up have not been found. It is unclear why these communication devices were designed to resemble such a macabre piece of anatomy, but we have no reason to suspect that our precursor race – as intelligent as they were – didn’t occasionally fall victim to gaudy fashion.

!*Blood Vials<br><br>Little is known about the function of these blood vials, though dozens have been found since Abstergo took an interest in their recovery at some point in the late 1980s. To date, only three have been found with their original contents intact, and of these, only one contained a confirmed sample of precursor DNA. Abstergo Industries executives have expressed a particular interest in locating more Precursor DNA and, if possible, samples of our so-called "Mitochondrial Eve." As far fetched as this sounds, please take special care to identify any vials you might stumble upon in a memory replay.<br><br>Unfortunately, as the average half-life of DNA is a mere 500 years, any sample old enough to belong to either source – 80,000 years or more – will have degraded well beyond usefulness. We suspect it would require a minimum of over 250 similarly preserved samples, and a hell of a lot of luck, to sequence an entire precursor genome… though the true figure is probably closer to 500.

!*Ah Tabai

Id: [0x00085A76]
!*Born: 1660s, Yucatan Peninsula<br>Died: Unknown<br><br>Named for the Mayan god of hunting, Ah Tabai’s given name remains a mystery, and very little is known about his earliest decades. We are still searching for a direct descendant, but fear this will be impossible – the only child he is known to have fathered died before the age of ten. <br><br>(Note: A ready-made tragedy, if we can find the right footage. Keep looking. -ML)<br><br>What little else we know about him comes from his own mouth; from the stories he told those who knew him. When speaking about his own past, he often avoids personal details in favor of abstractions and hints. He frequently speaks of his love and admiration for the tragic history of his people, and often used these stories to illustrate the complex intersections of cultures and religions, frequently pointing out the fact that “From within and without come enemies and allies alike. Nothing in life is guaranteed, except surprise...” <br><br>(Note: Aloof Mentor figures can work, but only if they have a soft side. A redemptive moment. -DM)<br><br>It is not known how early Ah Tabai acquired the title of Mentor, nor how large his impact was on the Assassins of the West Indies. We do know, however, than he maintained semi-regular contact with the Assassins in the British colonies to the north, in various parts of Europe and Africa, and in China. We also know that he was instrumental in opening his branch to men and woman from all walks of life – mostly Europeans, Africans, and those Native to the area.<br><br>As a native Mayan himself, rumors and stories of the ancient Observatory were not foreign to Ah Tabai. So, in 1713, rumors of a new “Sage” began to surface, Ah Tabai took it upon himself to locate this man for himself, believing the Assassins should be the protectors of this ancient and mysterious place. Ah Tabai sent word far and wide, to as many Assassin outposts as possible, hoping their network of spies and informants would lead them to their prize. But after two years, there was no word.<br><br>Then, at some point in early 1715, an experienced British Assassin named Duncan Walpole arrived at Ah Tabai's encampment, initially expressing a desire to train under the Mentor directly. Ah Tabai found the request odd but flattering, for Walpole had already achieved a level of Mastery few assassins ever reached. But after many months of intensive training, Ah Tabai came to consider Duncan Walpole as one of his most trusted colleagues. (Training montage. Would love this footage. -ML)<br><br>Then in June of 1715, word arrived that the Templars had located and imprisoned the Sage on Spanish lands in the far south. Seeing an opportunity to cripple his arch-enemies, Ah Tabai entrusted Duncan Walpole with the task of rallying various Assassins around the West Indies and leading an assault on the Templar prison ship en route to Havana. Duncan Walpole agreed to this task… and was never heard from again.<br><br>It was only after Edward Kenway’s disastrous meddling in Havana that Ah Tabai was made aware of the full extent of Walpole’s betrayal.

!*Edward Kenway

Id: [0x00085A78]
!*Born: 1693, Wales<br>Died: 1735, England<br><br>Edward James Kenway was born on the 10th of March in Swansea, Wales, to Bernard Kenway of Manchester and Linette Hopkins of nearby Cardiff. By Edward’s 10th birthday, his father had moved the family to a small farm just outside Bristol, a nearby port town in the southwest of England.<br><br>(Note: Not sure a WELSH leading man would be interesting. Can we do ADR to replace his voice? I know a great actor from London who’d be perfect. Speaks in a gravelly RP accent. --DM )<br><br>This relocation had a depressing effect on young Edward’s mood. He grew restless from a lack of contact with old friends and struggled to find an outlet for his limitless energy. By his teens he was spending more and more time in the city away from his farm, where the lure of excitement overrode prudence. By age 16 he had substituted a career as a successful farmer for a life of hopeless tomfoolery, frequently shirking his responsibilities to his family in favor of rough company.<br><br>In late 1711, at the age of 17, Edward met Caroline Scott, a woman of modest but steady means. Their friendship began cautiously, as Caroline’s hand had already been promised to the boorish son of a wealthy East India Company executive. But Edward’s charms eventually won out, and he and Caroline were married within a year of their meeting; a union that angered her father, and got the whole of Bristol talking.<br><br>(Note: Poor, handsome chap gets the wealthier, beautiful girl. This stuff just writes itself. --RL)<br><br>In the earliest months of their marriage, Edward resolved to do well by his wife and provide for her as he believed a man in his position should. But Edward’s grandiose dreams and exaggerated opinion of himself prevented him from taking immediate responsibility for their well-being. And after only a year, he had stumbled back into his worst habits – drinking, fighting, and idleness.<br><br>It was in this dark period that Edward revived an old idea of joining a privateering fleet sailing for the West Indies, with the aim of making war against the Spanish and collecting unchecked sums of gold and cargo. This, he told his wife, was their path to quick riches. Being a sensible and prudent woman, Caroline discouraged these fanciful ideas.<br><br>(Note: Is she a harpy? Does she nag him? Are we meant to hate her, or what? Because I certainly don’t want us to feel conflicted about Edward’s choices. He’s the hero. Let’s avoid scenes of him drinking or gambling. --OG)<br><br>By the summer of 1712, Caroline understood that her husband’s departure was inevitable. She wanted no further part of Edward’s reckless plan, and so left him to live with her parents. Stunned by this sudden turn, Edward was determined to earn his fortune fast and prove himself as capable as he always claimed he was. He left for the West Indies barely one month later, where he soon fell in with the privateer Benjamin Hornigold and his quartermaster, Ed Thatch.<br><br>Edward spent the first half of 1713 sailing with these two seasoned sailors, on regular sweeps of the windward passage. But that year, fate threw him another upset. With the signing of the treaty of Utrecht, all hostile actions between the major empires came to an end and the prospects of British privateers dried up. Now poor, unemployed, and thousands of miles from home, Edward and his colleagues settled on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas to reconsider their options. <br><br>These were fanciful days for Edward. He discovered in the small town of Nassau a life quite unlike that which he had left behind. The atmosphere of wild and noisy freedom in this small stateless encampment overwhelmed and captivated him. The drinking, the gaming, the women, the aimless desire to simply live as one pleased. And yet, as carefree as he was, his beloved Caroline was never far from his mind. If he could make something of himself in the West Indies – working a sugar plantation, perhaps -- he might win her back after all his time away.<br><br>But in absence of true conviction, habit takes hold fast; and it was only a matter of time before Edward set back out to sea with his mates, to live the life they knew best; no longer privateers – legal and sanctioned – but as pirates now, with nary a whit of loyalty to Kin and Country, earning his fortune by the sword and pistol, and praying his end was never too near… <br><br>(Note: If we can remove some of the more unseemly bits of his personality, this is a GREAT backstory. Edward’s bound to be a hit. –OG)

Jack eventually found work on one of the small plantations there, while Anne cultivated her ability to loaf and daydream. Unfortunately, her beauty, aloofness, and her incredible indifference to propriety made her the object of more romantic attention than she had ever known or cared for.<br><br>Within a year of arriving in Nassau, the Bonnys’ marriage was in shambles, a union only in name. While Jack disappeared further into his work, Anne grew more confident and sociable, eventually taking a job as a barmaid at the popular Old Avery tavern in the center of Nassau. And though she took on a few lovers in the next few years, it was mostly out of envy and spite that the rabble of Nassau branded Anne a harlot and a tease. But with no high society to shun or shame her, Anne’s desirability only increased on the strength of these rumors. <br><br>(Note: Tread VERY carefully here.

The first recorded instances of him are of his early exploits as a pirate in the West Indies around 1713-1714. <br><br>He was one of the earliest pirates to emerge after the end of the Spanish War for Succession, which gives us good reason to believe he was one of the many hundreds of privateers who were left without gainful employment in the ensuing peace. Like many other British mariners, Hornigold spent much of his time in the Bahamas, eventually settling in Nassau. It was from here launched his career as a full-fledged pirate, though he likely thought of himself as a privateer – in his earliest years, at least.<br><br>A skilful sailor and strategist, Hornigold lacked some of the ruthlessness required to be a truly successful pirate, and until 1716, refused to attack English ships out of a sense of loyalty to his home country. <br><br>(Note: A pirate with a sense of honor... would make a superb hero, IMHO, if our edits to Edward Kenway don’t pan out. –JM)<br><br>(Note: Agreed, J.

And with Charles Vane it's no different. We don't know where he was born, or where he grew up, or when he first took to sea. But maybe that's just as well, for it further heightens the mystery of this strange, unstable man.<br><br>Surely one of the most ornery and unstable of the "Flying Gang" -- the band of pirates who called Nassau their home for a time -- Charles Vane began his career like most pirates of the era -- honestly, as a privateer sailing for his King. Likely living in Jamaica in 1715, he was one of many aboard Henry Jenning's assault on a Spanish expedition to recover the gold from their ill fated wreck in 1715 off the coast of Florida.<br><br>Barely a year later it had become impossible to keep up honest work as a privateer, as British Governors were skittish about breaking the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, which called for a cessation of all aggression between the major empires. Having few other options, Vane sailed to Nassau where many of his former colleagues were now living.<br><br>Quick to anger and ferociously mean, Charles Vane quickly earned himself a reputation as a difficult Captain to sail under. At some point in 1717 or 1718. an old friend, "Calico" Jack Rackham joined his crew as quartermaster. The two remained partnered for some time, living and working out of Nassau with the likes of Benjamin Hornigold, Ed Thatch, and Henry Jennings.

!*Born: 1692, Trinidad<br>Died: ????<br><br>Born to enslaved Ogoni parents in Yoruba, Adéwalé was sold to the owner of a prosperous plantation before his teens. He remained on this plantation, working the fields, until his mid teens, always scheming of ways to escape his predicament but uneasy with the prospect of living life as a fugitive. <br><br>Then fortune struck, giving Adéwalé the sign he needed. At some point near his 16th birthday, a group of buccaneers raided the plantation, robbing it of raw cane, refined sugar and as many reales as they could find. Seeing in this an opportunity, Adé grabbed a crate of sugar and hauled it aboard one of the longboats the Buccaneers had rowed ashore. Surprised to see a slave among them, the Buccaneers were nevertheless thankful for the aid, and welcomed Adé among them.<br><br>Adé sailed with this first group of men for many years, quickly learning the ways of a seaman, grateful for the chance to develop his own skills and chase his own passions. And though his life among buccaneers was not free of the usual bigotry of the era, Adé found the prejudice to be more confrontational than restrictive.<br><br>In 1715, misfortune struck a cruel blow when the ship Adé was aboard, struck a shallow sandbar near the port of Havana. The buccaneers -- mostly British at the time -- tried desperately to free the trapped vessel, but after catching sight of an approaching Spanish Galleon, abandoned ship only to be torn apart by schools of circling bull sharks. Adé made peace with his fate, and stood his ground.<br><br>Taken to Havana for questioning and inspection, Spanish authorities eventually decided to send Adéwalé to Spain, where they felt he would make an excellent interpreter, owing to his fluent command of Spanish, English and French. Some weeks later, they loaded him into one of the Galleons that made up their perennial treasure convoy, en route to Seville.

!*Abstergo's archives contain a few references to men called "The Sage" or "A Sage", but they are few and far between. Each citing seems to refer to a different person living in a vastly different time and location. The earliest example was found on a Sumerian clay tablet in cuneiform script, while the latest survives only as a footnote in one of Laureano Torres's own journals, dated January 1704. In all -- according to Abstergo's existing research -- seven different "Sages" seem to have graced the world's stage in the past twelve hundred years. But the real number is likely higher.<br><br>Perhaps, the strangest aspect connecting each of these various sightings is the fact that, in every case, visual descriptions of each Sage are remarkably similar. So similar, in fact, that one wouldn't be faulted for assuming they were talking about a single, immortal man. However, in two of the seven citations, explicit mention is made of their death and burial. Are we therefore dealing with some bizarre form of reincarnation? Or some simpler explanation that eludes us at present? More research is required.

!*Born: 1682, Wales<br>Died: ????<br><br>Originally hailing from Wales, little is known about John Roberts, the real name of the man who would come to be known as "Black Bart" long after his death.<br><br>Most assume he went to sea at a very young age -- at 13 or so -- but there is no record of him in any historical documents until his noted appearance in 1718 aboard a merchant’s ship, Barbadian in origin. Just a year later our picture of Robert's life sharpens considerably. We now know he was pressed into piracy by the notorious Howell Davis while working aboard  a slave ship under Captain Abraham Plumb. And though Roberts had likely not gone to sea with the intent of becoming a pirate, when the opportunity thrust itself upon him Roberts was reported to have said ‘A merry life, and a short one shall be my motto.’<br><br>A few months later Davis was killed in an ambush on the Portuguese Island of Principe, and Roberts was swiftly and unanimously elected to replace him. This was surely a testament to the man's natural charisma and leadership, for he had been a pirate only a few months. It was at this point he took the name ‘Bartholomew’, likely naming himself for the infamous Bartholomew Sharpe, a pirate of some renown who had disappeared just two decades earlier.<br><br>One of the most intelligent and strategic pirates of the Golden Age, Roberts was a sturdy, handsome man, known to dress in fine clothes. A handsome man, who carried himself with a dignified but unpretentious air, he had dark hair to match his dark complexion, likely set from the almost two decades he had spent at sea. He often carried numerous pistols, each tied to one end of long silk sashes, which he kept slung over his shoulder. <br><br>His tactical ideas were usually radical, but thoughtfully considered. He never jumped into any scheme rashly, though his ideas seemed almost suicidal to those unacquainted with his methods. Ultimately responsible for the theft of around 400 ships in his 3 year career, he bested every other pirate of the era by a factor of 10 times or more, although it must be said that at least half these boats were small periaguas and the like.

It is also speculated that he arrived in the West Indies quite soon after leaving England.<br><br>If this was indeed the case, Ed Thatch would have seen his fair share of the War of Spanish Succession, a protracted fight between most of the Empires of Europe that pitted Britain against royalist Spain and France. In these early years, from 1700 to 1713, he would have been a privateer or at the very least a merchant seaman, doing his part for the crown -- Queen Anne at the time.<br><br>But with the Treaty of Utrecht bestowing peace upon a troubled Europe in 1713, Thatch and his fellow sailors would have found themselves far from home and out of work. They thus turned to piracy as a means of sustaining themselves. In the ensuing years, Thatch befriended a Captain named Benjamin Hornigold and soon after joined his crew as quartermaster, at some point between late 1714 and early 1716.<br><br>Settling in Nassau, Thatch, Hornigold, and the rest of the "Flying Gang" as these pirates called themselves, began cooking up schemes far larger than most pirates of the era dared dream. Wanting nothing less than a country of their own, they worked to turn Nassau into a place of liberty and freedom for all who desired an escape from the bonds of imperial rule.

!*Born: 1682, Jamaica<br>Died: ????<br><br>Of the few infamous pirates to call the West Indies his birthplace, Jack Rackham was born in Jamaica at the height of Port Royal's boom as a den of scoundrels. This would likely explain his atrophied moral compass, for he was frequently drunk, rarely serious about anything, and always chasing women. He used his outrageous and offensive charm to keep out of most trouble. But a strategist and fighter he was not.<br><br>Nicknamed "Calico" for his affinity for Indian and Asian prints, he was a terrible sailor and a worse pirate, given to flights of fancy and myopic ideas that served only himself, rather than solid strategic thinking. He was likely drunk for half of his adulthood, and had a weakness for women that trumped all basic needs, such as sleeping or eating. His disarming charm, dashing good looks, and his swift wit carried him far, but parties can only last so long before someone has to clean up after them.

He also claims to be the bastard son of the late William Kidd, the infamous privateer-turned-pirate who was captured and hanged by British authorities in 1701. Although James has no proof of this connection, his mother always insisted on it, claiming that she spent a single "panicked night of passion" with Captain Kidd just before his departure from London in 1695.<br><br>Growing up fatherless and with a spendthrift mother did little to improve his prospects at leading a normal life, and by the age of 12 he had found employment aboard merchant vessels sailing between the British colonies in north America and the West Indies. By the time he was 17, James called Jamaica his home, and he further honed his skills as a sailor here. <br><br>Although he never sailed with the likes of Ben Hornigold, Ed Thatch, or Edward Kenway, James was among the first sailors to settle in Nassau, and was a crucial figure in its development as a republic.

He married young and set about starting a family as soon as possible, but owing to what some called a "disorder of the mind" he never found solace or comfort in these domestic trappings.<br><br>To further complicate his unease, his firstborn son died in infancy, further amplifying his grief and stirring his restlessness.

Between 1704 and 1707 Rogers’ fortunes and family grew, and by the time he was twenty-seven his marriage to Sarah Whetstone had produced one son and two daughters.<br><br>By the end of 1707, however, his business had suffered great losses by raiding French forces, giving Rogers the idea to recoup these dreadful losses himself. Knocking about Bristol in search of a partner for this endeavor, he soon found himself in the company of William Dampier, an old friend and unlucky Captain who suggested setting out on a privateering expedition, one that would range far and wide about the New World. In 1708, Rogers made the necessary arrangements and set out as Captain of his own vessel, on a difficult voyage that would last over three years.<br><br>Along his course Rogers met with many successes and failures. In 1709, of the western coast of South America, he found and rescued a marooned sailor by the name of Alexander Selkirk, a sailor who had spent nearly 4 years living in isolation and who would serve as the inspiration for the book “Robinson Crusoe” just a few years later.<br><br>Soon after Selkirk’s recovery, Rogers’ fleet engaged an enemy vessel in open combat – a skirmish that earned him a pistol shot to the left side of his face and a mangled heel. Neither wound was enough to remove him from command however, and he continued serving as captain until his return to England in late 1711. To commemorate this return, he had an operation to remove the offending bullet from his upper palate.<br><br>(This guy is incredible!

Also at this time, Rogers was sued by former shipmates for allegedly hoarding goods and money plundered from enemy vessels. Rogers assembled a defense, but lost the case.<br><br>In 1713, itching to return to sea, he organized passage to Madagascar claiming to be a merchant in the slave trade, but with the intended purpose of reconnoitering the rumored pirate colonies established there. When he arrived in Madagascar after months of hard sailing, he found that the legends of the pirate town “Libertalia” had been exaggerated one-hundredfold. The pirates in Madagascar were sickly and few and desperate for help. After spending just a few months here, Rogers set sail for England, a failure in his own mind... <br><br>And yet, never one to give up hope, Woodes Rogers reoriented his attentions to the West Indies... eventually lobbying King George for a commission to hunt pirates in the Caribbean. On this score, he succeeded. After a few diligent years of making his case, King George appointed Woodes Rogers as the Governor of the Bahamas.

!*Born: around 1695<br>Died: Unknown<br><br>Born in Cuba, Assassin bureau leader Opía Apito was raised Taíno, among her mother's people, never knowing her father, a Spaniard.<br><br>At twelve, her village was raided by the Spanish. Most of her community was kidnapped or killed. But Opía, the lone free survivor, fought and ran. She survived in hiding for close to a decade.<br><br>Much of what we know of Opía is inseparable from legend. Her name, possibly self-given, is an amalgam of the Taíno words for "eternity" and "ghost." She claimed to be a direct descendant of the warrior, Hatuey, who stood against the Spanish in the 16th Century. She was guided throughout her life by the mantra, Aji aya bom -- better dead than a slave.<br><br>In her early twenties, she was hired by the Assassins as a guide, and was soon adopted into their ranks. She delighted in a characteristic Taíno approach to strategy: preferring to harm the enemy by taking something from him in battle, that he might live to notice it missing. But as an Assassin she did not shrink from violence. <br><br>True to her name, once promoted to Assassin Bureau leader, she built an agile and highly effective "ghost" bureau near the Cayman Islands, with virtually no physical footprint to speak of. We might regard it today as an early example of a terrorist cell, but she left no records and no descendants, and until now, history has held no record of it.<br><br>(I also found speculation that her father was the adventurer, Alejandro Marquez, which would have made her a sister to Lucia Marquez.- JM)<br>(Can we verify that? And what about the Hatuey connection?-ML)<br>(Almost none of this is verifiable. Half the books report the Taíno as "extinct" by this time. But their present-day descendants beg to differ.-JM)

!*Often used interchangeably, there are a number of important distinctions to make between these infamous, high-seas swashbucklers...<br><br>PIRATES: Criminals on the open sea who use coercion, intimidation and violence to rob innocent people of their cargo and transport. The term pirate is a catch-all and may be used generally to refer to all who perform acts of larceny on the open ocean. Pirates have been a problem since the advent of long-distance ocean travel; every age has seen its share of pirates, and every age has cursed their name and romanticized their cause.<br><br>During the so-called "Golden Age of Piracy" (roughly 1650 to 1725), the majority of pirates were from the British Isles. Most were young men in their 20s and almost all had already gained some experience as sailors prior to falling into piracy.<br><br>BUCCANEERS: Though often used as a synonym for Pirates now, the term Buccaneer refers more specifically to a group of pirates who lived and operated in the West Indies in the middle of the 17th century. Best known for attacking settlements and fortifications on land in large groups, the Buccaneers derived their name from the French term Boucanier -- an instrument used for smoking strips of meat over an open fire, a favorite sort of sustenance for these terrestrial pirates.<br><br>PRIVATEERS: Privateers were non-commissioned sailors who attacked and robbed given a Letter of Marque by their King or their king's official (such as a Governor),  Thus the distance between a Pirate and a Privateer is but a hair's breath of difference -- Pirates simply sail for one Monarch fewer.

At once international and civil, it ended with a series of treaties, in 1713 and 14, that saw King Philip the V remain in power, but lose his line to the French throne. <br><br>(Note: Let’s face it. He wasn’t really using that thing anyway. – RL)<br><br>Moreover, Philip kept his title of “Overseas Emperor” but relinquished much of his empire to the British, who were granted the exclusive right to slave trading in Spanish America for thirty years.<br><br>The century was nevertheless one of prosperity for the Spanish Empire, as their trade reputation grew steadily under Bourbon oversight, and continued to grow at an extraordinary rate until the 1780’s. <br><br>(Note: Gosh, I’m so glad they recovered from that slave-trading loss.

!*There were several attempts to found a town near the Havana Bay in the early 1500s. A settlement was established by the Spanish Conquistador Diego Valàzquez de Cuéllar around 1514. The city sits on a bay that opens to the Gulf Stream and thus became a natural stopping point between Europe and the Americas. In the earliest stages of the golden age of piracy Havana was burnt to the ground by French corsair, Jacques de Sores. By the 1700s, Havana was a large, heavily fortified port city where Spanish treasure ships would dock on their way to Europe. Pirates lurked on the approaches to the city, hoping to capture these same ships.<br><br>(Note: I've been trying to get the Cuban gov't in on this one to work a tourism angle, but they don't seem to understand mktg at all. -RL)

This city has a particularly colorful past: In 1706 the city's officially appointed Governor skipped town, thus severing the Crown's direct control over the Bahamas. <br><br>The islands languished for almost a decade in the hands of British citizens with little or no interest in Statesmanship. By 1713, the entire region had become a haven for pirates and it was in this period that Benjamin Hornigold declared Nassau to be a pirate republic. He proclaimed himself governor and thereafter every pirate of any sense and reputation used Nassau as a base of operation, transforming this small city of barely 1000 residence into "a nest of infamous bastards," according to the Governor of Bermuda.<br><br>(Note: Great find on the Pirate Republic.

!*A small island off the northern coast of modern day Haiti (Hispanola in the 17th and 18th century) which, because of its location off the Windward Passage, acted as a convenient center for piracy. The island was first spotted by Columbus, who named it because of its tortoise-like shape on the horizon. French buccaneers built a fort here and turned the island into a pirate stronghold.

!*Home to several indigenous tribes, the Florida peninsula was colonized by Spain some decades after Ponce de León's expedition explored the peninsula in 1513. During the age of West Indies piracy, Spanish treasure ships would sail up the Gulf Stream on their journey back to Cadiz. Southern Florida therefore became a natural point of attack for pirates and the Florida Keys a center of pirate recruitment. In particular, tropical storms famously shipwrecked several Spanish treasure fleets on the shores of Florida. Pirates and others flocked to pick through the wrecks and attack any survivors protecting the treasures.

!*Founded in 1670, Charles-Towne would grow to become Charleston, one of colonial America's busiest ports. In the early 1700s, defensive walls were built around the city's perimeter to defend the sparse settlement against attacks from Spanish and French privateers. Ironically, Blackbeard settled there with a pardon and continued his pirating ways in collusion with the colony's governor.<br><br>(Note: I know a little place on East Bay Street that makes a knockout mint julep. --DM)<br><br>(Note: You get paid for this? --JM)

!*Dating generally from the Mayan Classic period (AD 250 - 900), most Mayan ruins can be found throughout the Yucatán Peninsula and Central America. Mayan temples have steep stone steps and a platform at the top for wooden crowning structures. Mayan architecture is composed with a sophisticated eye to decoration, often using wall paintings and elaborate bas-relief stone carvings. Mayan arches forego the use of a keystone, instead creating a triangle-like arch known as a corbel vault.<br><br>(Note: Isn't this the civilization that disappeared for no reason? Or is that the Incas? --RL)<br><br>(Note: There are plenty of Mayans still living in that part of the world with their own rich culture, and a modern form of Mayan is still spoken there today. But, yeah, this once thriving civilization reached its height around 900 AD, before collapsing suddenly and declining slowly over the next few hundred years. People say it had to do with drought or short-sighted agricultural practices, but I don't think there's a standard agreement about what exactly happened. In any case, the last Mayan settlement was wiped out at some point in the late 16th century, about 40 years before the period we're studying. --DM)

!*The West Indies region is often beset by hurricanes and tropical storms. Combined with the shallow waters to be found there, the result is a high incidence of shipwrecks. Especially during the age of sail, vessels of all sizes were frequently tossed onto rocky shores. Their stranded crews often perished before they could be rescued.<br><br>(Note: the most famous shipwreck here was when ten treasure-laden Spanish ships got blown onto the coast of Florida in 1715. All and sundry came from all over the region to see if they could pick up some pieces of eight in the sand. Many of those people went on to try their hand at piracy. --RL)

!*To any and all who may reade this Missive, know First that I am Thom Kavanagh, born in 1652, formerly of Boston, now of the Worlde, living in the year 1706;– taken to Isolation long ago in the playce of my Ancestors in pursuite of Peace and Steadieness of Spirit. My storie is a singular one, though I make no Claim to Greatness or Nobility. Yet there is such an amount of Strangeness in my Blood it bears Mention, with the Wish that a better Understanding may come from my Situation;– and with the Hope that, if there be any others in the Worlde who suffer the same Perturbations of Minde as I have since Birth, they might find in me a kindred Soul;– and a friendly Voice to guide them to the calmer Shores of Sanitie....<br><br>In plaine Words, I was borne a Creature of two Souls, one being my owne, newly Mint'd and fresh upon the World's Stage;– yet, the other being an old and wyse Thing, a Soul as old as the Universe itself may be. Two Souls, therefore, in a single Body, competing for Supremacie.<br><br>For as long as I have been a thinking Being, I have felt these two Tydes stirring within me. How this mysterious Incorporation should have occurr'd shall be the Subject of future Lettyrs...

!*From Birth I was known to my Parents and Naybours as a Boy of straynge Habits and Impulses. My Eyes, being of inequal Colour and Dymension, alwayse invited odd Comment and Querie, being so easy to discern. But my Behayvior was also noticeablie queer;– I was given to Gesticulations of a mysterious Sorte; Sines and Symbols that appear'd to my Parents to portend a Meaning they could not deciffer. It was also said that I never did crie or protest;– strange for a Babe, but likely a Comforte to my dear Mother. <br><br>I gain'd the Gyft of Speache in my twelfth Month, my first Wordes being “My Love” and “Beloved”. My Parents seized upon this as a Good sign of robust Intelligence, but could not have been much pleas'd with what such Words Implied;– and ryght they were to be anxious, for at such a Tyme that I should have call'd these kind Shepherds "Mother" and "Father", by the age of two Yeares, I had alreadie taken to reffer to them Elizabeth and Thomas;– a queer sort of Quirk for an Infant, it needn't be said. But this was my Impulse, and until I pass'd through Adolescence, was a Practice I stuck to...

!*Of the City I call'd Home for nigh two Decades, I have nothing but fond Memories. Boston was a Place of grate Beautie and Peace. My Father was a Cobbler by trade and my Mother kept a moddest House as she raysed me as best she could;– and together, we lived along the southern Shores near the Wharffs that saw the Tallships in their comings and goings, shuttling all mannor of Goode to and from this young Colonie.<br><br>I remember being alwayes fascinated by those Ships and the Promise of Adventure they Presaged;– and it was not for wont of Distraction or Imagination that I spent many a Morning sitting upon the Docks to watch them enter the Harbour from Locations afar, or disappear from it, sinking into the Horyzon as silently as a Dream. I wonder'd then what lay beyond that thin Line of Azure, and in Wondering set the Course of my Desire: I wish'd to travell, to discover.<br><br>So it was that I Knew from those early Days I would not live out my Lyfe in Boston, but would range far and wyde in search of the Source of the strange Secrets within me. Of that, more shall be writt at another Tyme. But lett it be knowne that I was content for a Tyme, and that I loved my Parents very much...

Id: [0x00085C9B]
!*I recall with grate Claritie the day of my first Reverie. Heretofore, I had onley the SENSE of my bicameral Mind;– but on this Day I was offerr'd a Glimpse as if through a Window into that second buried Soul;– into the second Lyfe within me.<br><br>I was four Years of Age, and it was a fresh Autumn day. I was outt with my Parents upon an Excursion, strolling about the place call'd Beacon Hill. We, having onley concluded our Picnicking, now ranged about the Peake to take view of the Citie below.<br><br>It was then a Coolness fell upon me. The World seem'd to darken and glowe all at once. I fell back, landing, it seem'd, into a pair of coddling arms. A voice said to me, "Go Beloved. Go to your rest." As eerie as this was, a deep Love suffused me. The voice went on;– "Your sacrifyce will not have been in Vain. And though you must pass from this Lyfe, I will see you renew'd. Reborn to remain at my Side forever..."<br><br>Never before, and rarely since, had I felt such a Depth of Adoration. Then the skies clear'd and the Worlde light'd and I woke supine with my Parents looming over me, calling my Name...

Id: [0x00085C9C]
!*It is with deep Sadness I shoulde now relate the Genesis of my feeling of grate Isolation from my Parents, even att so young an Age, and my powerfull Sense that I was too muche different from them;– meaning, that though they had borne me and raysed me, I seem'd not of their Issue, norr of their Kinde. And the Reverie described previously cast this Feeling in a firmer Mould;– I seem'd not to be of this Worlde att all. Indeed there were Days when I felt not remotely Human at all, but of an other Kinde of Creayture entire.<br><br>Between the Time of my fourth Year and my fourteenth, I was given to such a Profusion of Reveries and Ideas and Dreams that I should sound mad to describe them, yet by outward Appearance I was as normal as any Ladd, and further, was never particularlie troubled by what cross'd my Minde;– Visions of grate Cities made of Glass; Portraits of beautiful Men and Women in great flowing Robes; Machines that generated Lightening as easily as Thunderclouds; Vehicles that flewe in the Skies as Birds...<br><br>As I say, Ideas and Visions too fancifull to be Entertain'd by any sane Mindes, yet all to reale in my Heade to be ignored...

!*When I was aged fourteen Yeares, my Father, feeling I shoulde discover some better Skill or Trade sensible to my Habits of Mind, Apprentyced me to a Master Carpenter-Joiner call'd Jonathan Davenport of Boston. Master Davenport had then many Slaves and two other white Boyes in his Emploie;– one a Bricklayer by trade and the other a Carpenter, bothe not terrible Clever. But seeing in me a certain Spark of Intelligence and Wytt, Master Davenport was all too keene to place me as a Joiner;– and I was happie to oblyge, the Position earning me some 2 Pound a Year and grate Satysfaction of Spirit.<br><br>A Joiner’s work requires a nice and steadie Hande, and a grate Taste in Ornament;– both Qualties Master Davenport tolde me I hadd in large Measure. And so it was with grate Pryde that, well pryor to the customarie seven Yeares, I tooke leave of my Master after only five, and set out on my owne at nineteen Years of Age to seek my Success, now a Man and Master in my owne ryght. My Master was not sadd to see me go, but bade me goode Fortune, for he knew in his heart that I was the greatest Talent he had yet apprentyced. – “For there is something of a natural Genius in you, Ladd;– A Wisdome beyond your Yeares.”<br><br>And so packing a Kitt of all my worldly Possessions, I bid my Mother and Father much Love and Farewell, then took Passage on a Merchant Brig bound for Jamaica in the West Indies, where need for Carpenters of Skill were grately needed...

!*It paines me now to think on my Feelings of my Departure from Boston, and from my Deare parents, who raised me so well, for in hyndsight I think perhaps I should have been melancholie, or anxious at the least. Yet leaving Home at so spry an Age ranks as one of the grate Joys of my Lyfe;– never before or since did I ever feel such an Embrase of Freedom.<br><br>Yet, not all concerning my Leaving was Joyous, as it was around this Tyme that the Voices came upon me strong;– much like a Man whispering in my Eares, these Voices were neither synister in Nayture, nor did they prevent mature Dealings with my fellow Man. But, unlike my Reveries, which came to me in my Sleep or in Daydreams, these Voices came upon me at Times inconvenient to my present Purpose. Day and Night, they intruded without Provocation. And though they were not constant, they were certainlie frequent in Nature;– and strangest of all, had the Qualities of memories. There were tymes too that I seem'd to heare my owne Voice among them.<br><br>Was it possible that I heard Conversations from a previous Lyfe? Memories of those I knew, Memories of Engagements long past? In the next Lettyr I shall relate what were perhaps the most confounding Snatches of Conversation...

Id: [0x00085C9F]
!*Here I relate one such Memorie, repeat'd ad nauseum through the whole of my Lyfe:<br><br>MYSELFE, A MAN, AND TWO WOMEN;–<br><br>A Woman;– "As biological Traites are pass'd from one Generation to another, why should we not engineer the Humans to pass learn'd Information to their offspring as well? It is well within our Scope." And here an other Woman interrupts;– "Never! Alreadie we have made them sturdy and strong! Why should we gift them with new Advantages over us? We are dyeing, the War is tilting against us;–  we should discover a means to our own Salvation, not theirs!"<br><br>And here the Man disagreed;– "Our time is done. The Instruments of our Will shall soon be our masters, and we shall fade away. Perhaps not in ten or twenty Yeares, but certainlie this Centurie is our last. Why not therefore gift the Humans with add'd faculties for Wisdom and Growthe. Why not let them pass on the accumulations of their Learnings, from one Generation to the Next? By ever ascending Degrees, the Humans shall be as Wyse as we are..."<br><br>And here I seem to speak;– "It can be done. By simple Manipulation of the Code within their Blood, we could improve their Lott" And here the second woman screams "Absolutelie not!";– And then the Memorie is end'd...

!*Upon my Rowte to the West Indies, a Curiouse incident aroused in me a Revelation. It was a wanton Act of Violence that I witness'd, one that proved fatal only to its Instigator: a pardon'd Pyrate named Savory who had come aboard to Work off his Debts as an honest Christian, yet died a Devil full of Drink after mistaking the reasonable Abjurations of his fellow Men for Insults. He was taken by a self-inflict'd Pistol Shot, sustain'd as he attempt'd to load his Piece in preparation for the first of six Duels which he had arranged as Challenges against our Groupe. <br><br>All of us were sad for his Misfortune, but none were sorry that our Crew grew quieter in his Absence. And yet, at seeing the poor chap wound himself so, and witnessing the Blood freely flowing from his Bodie, a Notion sprung upon me like an Idea long dormant, alreadie within me yet awaiting a Chance to reappear. <br><br>Thence came the Phrase I had heard before, springing to my Minde: "The Code in their Blood";– suddenly it was sensible to me! The Code of Lyfe, like a Shipbuilders Draughts in miniature, yet responsible for building each and every Man and Woman on Earth. How was it that such an Idea made perfect Sense to me? How was it I understood alreadie that which had no Prescedent in the most modern Philosophies? The Code of Lyfe. In our Blood. Imagine!<br><br>These Ideas swirl'd within me for many Weeks upon that Voyage, spinning in such a Maelstrom of thought I could not Articulate them...

!*Reaching Jamaica I push'd all idle Thoughts and Fantasies from my Minde and set about finding myself Employment. A Letter of Endorsement from my Mentor, Mister Davenport, hasten'd my Success and within a Fortnight I was abel to secure an Interview with an Agent working for the esteemable Mister Peter Beckford, a Man knowne wyde acrosse the West Indies as a One of Honour and good Intelligence;-- as, I must say, was his Agent, for the Man hyred me on the Spot, and within a two Days’ time was I set to work upon the Slaves Quarters;-- fitting them with sturdier Doors and tighter Rooves. <br><br>For my owne accommodations, I am well pleased to tell they were fine. Three windows had I, two of which look'd upon the Cane Fields. When open'd, a light Breeze fill'd my Room, one scent'd with the raw Perfume of the nearby Sea, and the distant Sound of a hushing Ocean Surf. Often too the spiritual Songes of the Negros hard at worke enter'd, and gave me a deepe calm. It was pleasant there, only this Comfort could not mask the Dread I felt at the Thought of catching the Yellow Fever, or another of the innumerable Ailments that often struck those newly arrived to these Parts. For my Parte I saw well over seventeen Men and Women perish from the Disease within six Months of my Arrival. <br><br>It seem'd, then, that for every success I hadd, another two or three potential Hazzerds lay in waite. And as tyme would tell, this proved most unfortunately True...

!*Of my Employer I must say Something, for it was owing to his Connexions that I came to find such troubled Dealings. Peter Beckford was a Man of grate Charisma and Pryde. In 1662, he had come to Jamaica and in just 10 yeares had fast-procured himself a sizable Portion of Land which he sow'd with Cane as early as he was able.<br><br>Upon my coming into his Orbit, he own'd – claim'd all about him – one of the largest private Holdings of Land in all the World, rivalling only Kings and Emperors for his Largesse. This same Surpluss applied to the Number of slaves in his emploie;– whereas he had arrived in Jamaica with a compliment of three, he now own'd the better part of three-hundred.<br><br>A shrewde and relentless man of Business, Mister Beckford was known also be subservient to a Temper of cyclonic Power;– Wrath and Fury and Enmity were his primary means of settling Arguments that could nott be concluded in Mister Beckford’s immediate favor. He was however always kinde to me and as gracious a Man as one could hope an Employer to be. But this I put down to my Status in his eyes;– he was a traditionall Man with a Respect for Rank and Breeding.<br> <br>In earlier Tymes he hadd been the Governor de facto of the Island, and though a Statesman no longer upon my Arrivall he still bore all the Sines of a man who felt it his natural Dutie to lead. Further, his political Connexions he valued as deeply as his Sugar and the Money it brought him;– and it was in this Capacity, following the arrival of a Spanish soldier, that I met the man who would change my Lyfe for the worse, forever;– a young man named Laureano Torres.

Id: [0x00085CA3]
!*It was in April of 1673 when I espy'd the Galleon in Kingston’s Harbour, flying the Colours of the Men of Holland, which I thought queer but not unlikely. This was a Ruse, however, for the Ship’s Cargo was most assuredly Spanish;– a Gentleman call'd Torres, once a soldier in the Spanish army, now an Emissary on behalf of his King. Or so said he to Peter Beckford. I learn'd later that he call'd himself a Templar, and had made his Visit to Beckford’s Plantation to look upon Master Becford's straynge collection of collect'd Manuscripts. <br><br>Torres was two Days with Mister Beckford when another Object took his full Attention;– namely, me. The Syght of my Face stirr'd in him a strange sort of Excitement, which I found altogether untoward at first, until he ply'd me with Questions that shock'd me to the Core of my Being. Said he to me, one evening after Supper– “Hear you voices, Mister Kavanagh?” – “How is that?” I answer'd, feigning Ignorance, though shaken in Truth. “Voices. From the dark of your Minde. Or Memories, to be clearer, as if from another Lyfe entire.” And here I was terrified;– how was it that this man knew the odd Riddle of my Lyfe as if it were a banal Fact of History?<br><br>“I know not what you mean, Master Torres” said I, and took my Leave of him, so anxious as I was. “Goodnight to you, Sir” said he, as I depart'd. “We shall speake again when you are rest'd and ready to talk.” Still shaken, I bade him good Night and made for my Bedchamber, feeling another Reverie coming strong upon me. When I reach'd my Bed, I fell into bothe...

Id: [0x00085CA4]
!*Here I relate another Reverie…<br><br>MYSELFE AND A WOMAN;--<br><br>“Beloved,” said she, a voice so intimate and familiar, “Our Colleagues conspire against us. They dither and sigh, resign'd to their Fates, content to champion the Humans. But there is Hope for us; there is a chance we might inure our Bodies to the chilling Worlde, the poison'd Atmosphere, and the war itself. Will you aid me? Will you submit?”<br><br>And here, I hear my owne Voice in answer;--“Yes, Beloved. What must I do?”<br><br>“Tranference,” said she “The shuttling of our Mindes from these old Bodies into new Forms. Mechanical bodies perhaps, or into those of our Instruments, our Humans. In short, I believe there may be a way to transfer all we knowe and all we are into other forms... in this way we may survive the coming Cataclysm and live to see our People repopulate the Earth, and recover her from those we foolishly set loose upon it.”<br><br>“Tranferance,” I said aloud. “Our minds into alternate Vessels? A dangerous Prospeckt, but reasonable.”<br><br>“Yes!” said she, “And who better to make this Leap than you my beloved Husband. With a Minde unparallel'd. A Constitution unrivall'd. Arckitect of the Observatorie, Overseer of Eden’s tools, the brightest light in our Civilization. If you are not capable of making this leap, perhaps no one is...”<br><br>And here replied I;--“I will do this for you, Beloved. For us and our people...”

!*Lost as I was in my Reverie, I fail'd to see the Envelope slipp’d ‘neath the Door to my Bedchamber. It read thus: “Dear Sir, forgive the Alarm I must have raised with my Queries, but you have the exact Likeness of a Man my Colleagues and I have long'd to meet. Allow me an Audience and I will explain all. Your Friend, Laureano Torres." <br><br>I ponder’d this Letter for some time that Evening, wondering what it could mean that I had the “exact Likeness” of a Man he knew, and why it should raise so much Intrigue. I wonder'd at this for hours, Pacing about the Room with a Minde to slip from my Chamber, when of a sudden I hearde a rapide Succession of Reports from Pistols and Rifles, outside in the Garden. To my Eare it sound'd as if a Warr had begun, with me a Bystander at its Center...<br><br>I dropp’d to my Knees and hid on the far side of my Bed, away from the Window, and shutt my eyes. But as I did this, a voice call'd out to me from my Chamber door. “Mister Kavanaugh!” it said. I raysed my head and open'd my eyes and there saw a Figure cutting a terrible Outline;– hood'd and robed in dusky Sienna, the Man lift'd a small Pipe to his Lipps and blew. I felt a Sting upon my Neck, as if from a Mosquito. I open'd my Mouth to Protest, but thereupon a Wave of Fatigue took me and I fell fast asleep...

!*I awoke some Days hence in a bustling Native village in the Presence of that same man, many Leagues from where I had call'd my Home. A Native himself, with a strong and serious but gentle Face, he named himself Bahlam, and bade me nott be fryghten’d. <br><br>Strangely, I was not;– for his demeanor was calm and his words were kind. I ask'd him why he had brought me to this Place. His Surprise seem'd genuine, and he told me, “You are a Sage. Your face tells it plain;– your Eyes most of all.” I did not know what to make of this Suggestion. He went on;– “You are but one of a long Lineage of identical Men;– men born outside their original Tyme. Your Likeness and your Soul are a Pattern, repeat'd through the Ages. Oftentimes a century or more passes without the appearance of a Sage; other times, Two are born in the same Decade. We know not why.”<br><br>And dash my Brains, but all he spoke was knowne to me in some intrinsick Way, and yet it frighten'd me all the same. How could it be that I was a Man reborn? How could it be that I had already lived one Lyfe, and had plodd'd through a second, still pondering the first? I spent many a Day with this man Bahlam, and in that time he told me all he knew, then ask'd questions of his own he hoped I might answer...

Id: [0x00085CA7]
!*For severall Days, I stay'd with my Captor, Bahlam, asking him all mannor of Questions and he asking the same of me;– and all the While I wonder'd what Fate he intend'd for me. At last, on the seventh Day I reveal'd what lay heavy on my Heart.<br><br>“What do you want of me, Sir, that you keep me prisoner so?” And at this, Bahlam, laugh'd and answer'd “You are no Prisoner, Sage! You may take your Leave at any Point. Only tell us where you wish to be dropp’d, and if it be in our Power, we shall transport you thence.”<br><br>This Answer surprised, then anger'd me;– “Why then did you spirit me away with such a diabolical Method? Kidnapp'd, no less!” And said he in Answer “Your Master host'd a Templar, and may now be one himself. Such Men are not to be trust'd with a Prize so valuable as you. Steer clear of them, for they seek the Knowledge that hides in your Minde. Your Dreames, your Memories, and the Location of a Place once dear to you... The Observatorie.”<br><br>This word rang in my Eares, for I had heard it before. Another Memorie from a Tyme long ago. “And what do YOU desire of me, Sir?" I ask'd him. “Would you Steale the Secrets buried within me too?” Bahlam smiled;– “I would not shun them, but to share them is a Point for you to decide. Your Secrets are your own... and yours alone to Lend...”

Id: [0x00085CA8]
!*After my difficult Counsel with Bahlam, I took a Day to ruminate on what should be done. Notions straynge and uncertain battled in my Head for Supremacie, and I was never on one Idea long before its Opposite seem'd a better Option. Yet at last made my Decision. <br><br>“Sir, you have been gracious with me,” I told him;– “And my Trust in you is compleat. Yet I cannot share my Visions and Memories without first understanding them myself. I must therefore take my Leave and travel in secret to a Playce that has occupied my Thoughts for many Yeares.”<br><br>Bahlam smiled and said;– “I understand well, and I believe in your Cause. To find the source of your Reveries will do you a great Good. Go, therefore, and answer these Riddles. We will provide you with supplies to see you safely embark'd.” To which I replied; “Thank you, Sir. And if what I finde satisfies me, I will return hither and provide you with answers that may satisfie you as well.”<br><br>In the days following, Bahlam was true to his Word. With his young son, Ah Tabai, in tow, he transport'd me first unto a fishing Village near his own Compound, and supplied me with Maps and Coin before issuing a Warning. “The Templars are lately come to the West Indies, and this Torres is their Grandmaster;– and though few now in Number, there must soon be Others. Take heed of them, and trust not their Entreaties. For what they cannot earn by Conversation, they will take by Force.”<br><br>And with this, and a hearty goodbye, I took my Leave of this "Asssassyn" and set out for parts unknown, a vague sense of purpose pulling me forward...

!*After leaving Bahlam, I set out in a Sloop of my own and travell'd for nigh-on one Yeare about the West Indies, sailing with a small crew to all mannor of Jungles and Playas and Beaches, looking for a Sine, or a Landform that might spark in me a Memorie. <br><br>Along my Way I met many a fine Peoples who did me great Kindnesses, and offer'd Work in exchange for more Provisions. In this way, I came to know the people of the new World and of the old, and found in all of them the same Hopes and Desyres. To travell is truley the finest education.<br><br>Then, after my thirteenth Month a-roving, I found my Object well-inland on a known Island;– here it was, the place Bahlam had call'd The Observatorie. O, what Memories the Location aroused! Well prior to clapping Eyes upon its Structure, I knew I had come to the correct spot. Leaving my men on shore, I pass'd alone through Jungles and deep Ravines, coming at last upon the Spot, and there marvel'd at its straynge and forboeing Presense.<br><br>Without prompt, I knew what do;– I press’d my Finger into what I knew to be a Portal, and upon its opening, I pass'd inside. What I saw there, however, shall remain a Mystery, for the World is not yet readie to hear my Tales, which should sound like Sorcery to all but my Friend, Bahlam, and perhaps the Templars who likely chase me still...

!*I remain'd alone at the Observatories Location, plumbing its Secrets, all the while besieged by such an influx of Reveries it would require a Tome twice the size of a Bible to relate them all. Let it suffice to say, that I came to understand the Nature of the two Souls within me, and I am now content.<br><br>After near on a Week there, I was visit'd by a Group of Natives from the Island, people of the Tiano tribe, I believe. They spott'd me first, and might have kill'd me straight away, had my utter surprise not widen'd my Eyes to such a Degree that their unusual qualities were seen by all. At seeing me thus, the Natives stopp'd and and dropp’d to their knees with slow Gesticulations. I understood at once that these men were sworn to protect this place, and in my further Conversations with them since, I have made out that it was a PREVIOUS Sage who had employ'd them so;– or more precisely, I should say employed their Ancestors thus, for nearly 150 years had pass'd since the last “Sage” had come this way. I am told his Grave lies nearby, but is unmark'd and inaccessible. <br><br>It has now been over four Decades since my Arrival at this sacred Place, and onlie one Question yett lingers in my Minde;– how many more of my Sort have been here in Total? near eighty Millennia have pass'd since our Inception, and I am apt to believe the Number quite high. But I cannot knowe for certain.<br><br>But let that not trouble you, Reader;– for if you have followed my Storie entire, look you for my final Missive in the Playce where I will soon surely lay. Hidden near the Observatorie, where I have instructed the Guardians of this place to burie me when my Passage across this mortal Coil is at it's End. Therefore, fare thee well, until then.

!*As I wryte, the Yeare is now neare upon 1706, and I am sicklie and in poor Condition, and so must tell what little else I can of my Condition;-- all I tell here, I have dredg'd from the dark Voide of my Memorie. I cannot confirm or prove what I argue, but perhaps if some Others like me were to see this, they too would understand, and feel not alone as I so often have.<br><br>In my originale Lyfe, I died in the midst of my Beloved’s experiment. This Method of which she spoke – of the Transference of Mind into Machine, and from thence into a Human Body –- was a Failure. Yet an instructive one, I believe. For in my last Moments, I Recollect her comforts to me, and a cleare Promise that my death would not be an end, but a beginning. <br><br>“There is another Way, Beloved,” said she to me, “Imperfect, yet possible. Firstly, I will agree to carry out Minerva’s experiments, her terrible Gift to the Humans. Yet my purpose will be contrary;-- my purpose will be your Immortality! In collecting Samples of the Code in the Human’s blood, I will add my own Augmentations;-- Samples of your Code, transfigured in such a way that when the proper Pieces come together, it may further transfigure the Zygote of a newly conceived Child. In this Way, you shall be reborn, again and again throughout the Ages. With luck, this recessive Recurrence shall never die out, but travell on like a Raft downstream along the Tide of Inheritance.”<br><br>I was dying as she spoke, there in my Beloved’s Arms, but I understood her Meaning well. “Look for me, Beloved! Your Death will not be in Vain. For I WILL be with you again. Entomb'd. Lying in waite! Ready to emerge again when the Tyme is ryght!"<br><br>She then pierced me through the Heart, thus ending my Lyfe. How trulie bizzare it is;-- that I can claim to have Memorie of my own death is a Ludicrous idea. And yet I know know thatt it happen'd, and that I now live again, many Centuries from that Tyme, waiting for the final piece of this Riddle to reveal itself... yet how this will be, I cannot say.<br><br>Thus, to any and all who have read this and understood little;-- be not upset. For there is more Mysterie than Sense in the World, and our only Purpose is to endure it! --T.K. 1706

It’s a safe and well-documented process.)<br><br>Steps:   <br>1- Acquisition<br>2- Extraction<br>3- Exploration<br>4- Editing<br><br>What some call animal instinct, Dr. Warren Vidic termed Genetic Memory. Locked within our DNA are records of our ancestor’s lives.<br><br>The Animus is a device that renders genetic memories in three dimensions. It’s a window to the past that allows you to experience history, but not change it. That happens later, in editing!<br>Once, we were bound to explore only the genetic memories of our own ancestors, but today it’s possible to research within the memories of any ancestor for whom Abstergo Entertainment holds a viable sample for extraction. And all with negligible side-effects.<br><br>Note: genetic memory records for a given ancestor end at the moment of conception, when genetic material is passed on.

!*Chichen Itza<br><br>One of the most popular tourist attractions in Mexico today, Chichen Itza was once one of the largest cities of the pre-Columbian Maya civilization. Boasting a mix of architectural styles from across the empire, it is also known to include contributions from members of the First Civilization believed to have fought on the front lines against the human rebellion. In particular, the technologically advanced system of caves, tunnels and puzzles that runs underground between the Castillo Temple and the Cenote Sagrado are rich with First Civilization artifacts. Excavated in the eighteenth century, in a controversial dig ordered by Madeleine de L’Isle, these range from Prophecy Disks to Rings and Shards. Voluminous in quantity, they are minor but culturally significant artifacts which, as a collection, provide us with the best picture we have of life on Earth in the months preceding the Toba Catastrophe. The site is currently under federal protection, but we are close to reaching an agreement with the Mexican government.

!*Bermuda Triangle<br><br>What must surely be the most intently studied region whose very existence is routinely denied by official sources, the Devil’s Triangle has been held responsible for countless vanished vessels—aircraft and ship alike- since the earliest days of sail. The region’s technomnivorous tendencies have been attributed to many magnetic pull of the lost continent of Atlantis, to UFOs and even to unnamed “mysterious forces.” While the area still holds much interest, and we firmly believe in the power of science over superstition, we have been unlucky in researching this area, and can claim only to have contributed two small aircraft, a ship, and several hundred thousand dollars of research equipment to the hungry maw of its continued mystery. For the time being, it may be safer to pursue greater knowledge of the region through genetic memory research, via the Animus programme.

Id: [0x00085E86]
!*Aleya Ghost Lights<br><br>It is the opinion of this researcher that inadequate attention has been paid to South East Asia, and in particular, the Himalayas. Our research into First Civilization peoples, and the subtle “fingerprints” they have left throughout throughout the world would benefit greatly from further investigation into this region. For example, we may find a prime example, in the form of the Alyea “Ghost Lights.” Often reported by fishermen* the lights appear over marshes, and possess the power to distract, waylay, and even compel victims to drowning, but have also proven useful as navigational aids. “Gas” seems like too facile an explanation. Has genetic memory research yielded evidence of anything similar yet? <br><br>Ghosts or gas or something else? In the Himalayas, these are said to be the souls of deceased fishermen.<br><br>*We really don’t take fishermen seriously enough, do we? How many times has a simple “fisherman village” yielded significant information, if not treasure?

Id: [0x00085E87]
!*Lake Vostok<br><br>Working with our Russian partners, we have secured an agreement to commence research into the subterranean lake that rests deep beneath Vostok Station, in the accurately if poetically named Pole of Cold, on the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. Sitting approximately 3500 meters above sea level, this freshwater lake rests 4,000 meters beneath the surface. A core ice sample was extracted in 2012, and we will soon begin research that should provide a paleoclimatic record going back some 400,000 years. Isolated fossil water reserve samples may prove even older. Only time and science will tell what genetic marvels these magnificent samples will reveal, if not a new window into First Civilization life itself.

!*Easter Island<br><br>Located at the southeastern point of the Polynesian Triangle, “Big Rapa” is home to some 887 Moai statues created by the Rapa Nui people. One of the most isolated inhabited islands, a territory of Chile, protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it has proven difficult to study closely in this century. Some records are available from the eighteenth century, when the Rapa Nui suffered from disease communicated by European sailors. Ninteenth and twentieth century records indicate slave raids, famine, war, and deforestation. Despite this rich and perhaps tragic history, it is the Moai statues that are most heavily protected. Carved from the stone of an extinct volcano, it is not known how they were transported for installation. This “mystery” fascinates tourists, but if we could gain access to conduct a private archaeological excavation of the island, it is the petroglyphs and network of caves established by even earlier civilizations that we believe would yield the most productive results.

!*Born: 1702, Ireland<br>Died: Unknown<br><br>Anne was barely a teen when she left her native Cork in Ireland for the British colonies, and by sixteen she was en route to West Indies at side of her new husband, Mr. Jack Bonny, a gentle but sturdy young man in his early 20s. <br><br>The pair arrived in Nassau in April of 1716, settling down with an unclear idea of what shape their lives might take. Jack eventually found work on one of the small plantations there, while Anne cultivated her ability to loaf and daydream. Unfortunately, her beauty, aloofness, and her incredible indifference to propriety made her the object of more romantic attention than she had ever known or cared for.<br><br>Within a year of arriving in Nassau, the Bonnys’ marriage was in shambles, a union only in name. While Jack disappeared further into his work, Anne grew more confident and sociable, eventually taking a job as a barmaid at the popular Old Avery tavern in the center of Nassau. And though she took on a few lovers in the next few years, it was mostly out of envy and spite that the rabble of Nassau branded Anne a harlot and a tease. But with no high society to shun or shame her, Anne’s desirability only increased on the strength of these rumors. <br><br>(Note: Tread VERY carefully here. And triple-check any racy footage you get. 18 or older, no exceptions. –OG)<br><br>(Note: Or how about we just don't go this route? For once? –DM)<br><br>After living and working in Nassau to no great purpose, Anne eventually fell for the roguish charms of "Calico" Jack Rackham. A man who had already fallen into and out of piracy, Rackham was just the sort of character to lure Anne away from her dull marriage.<br><br>It was also around this time that Anne befriended Mary Read, whose manly disguise she had seen right through. The two grew to be close friends, much to the consternation of Rackham, who threatened Mary with violence for flirting with his prize. Mary, to diffuse the situation, revealed herself to Rackham too... much to his delight no doubt.<br><br>A few months later, for reasons not entirely clear, Anne, Mary and Rackham raised a small crew, slipped aboard a moored schooner, and sailed from Nassau's port under cover of darkness. Their goal was to execute a series of swift robberies before retiring with enough gold to live on, but once again Rackham's incompetence proved disastrous.<br><br>Within 3 months of setting out, Anne and Mary found themselves alone on the deck of their stolen, damaged schooner, fighting off waves of British soldiers as Jack and the rest of his crew lay below deck, passed out from a heavy night of drinking. They were outnumbered, and quickly detained. The British authorities, surprised to find two women fighting so fiercely as pirates, deigned to make a show of their subsequent trial. But Anne and Mary had a plan of their own. Unbeknownst to the British, both were pregnant -- Anne by Rackham, most likely, and Mary by an unnamed sailor -- a fact which they revealed just as the judge passed a sentence of execution on them.<br><br>Owing to the fact of their being "quick with child", the judge stayed their executions until they came to term. Some 4 months later, Mary had her child, but died soon after in prison of a terrible infection. Until now, Anne's fate was unknown... lacking an execution log or death certificate, it was commonly assumed that her father came to her rescue, paying the Governor off and spiriting her back to the British colonies in North America. But we now know the true story. The only question remains is: what to do with it?

!*Born: 1682, Wales<br>Died: 1722, West Coast of Africa<br><br>Originally hailing from Wales, little is known about John Roberts, the real name of the man who would come to be known as "Black Bart" long after his death.<br><br>Most assume he went to sea at a very young age -- at 13 or so -- but there is no record of him in any historical documents until his noted appearance in 1718 aboard a merchant’s ship, Barbadian in origin. Just a year later our picture of Robert's life sharpens considerably. We now know he was pressed into piracy by the notorious Howell Davis while working aboard  a slave ship under Captain Abraham Plumb. And though Roberts had likely not gone to sea with the intent of becoming a pirate, when the opportunity thrust itself upon him Roberts was reported to have said ‘A merry life, and a short one shall be my motto.’<br><br>A few months later Davis was killed in an ambush on the Portuguese Island of Principe, and Roberts was swiftly and unanimously elected to replace him. This was surely a testament to the man's natural charisma and leadership, for he had been a pirate only a few months. It was at this point he took the name ‘Bartholomew’, likely naming himself for the infamous Bartholomew Sharpe, a pirate of some renown who had disappeared just two decades earlier.<br><br>One of the most intelligent and strategic pirates of the Golden Age, Roberts was a sturdy, handsome man, known to dress in fine clothes. A handsome man, who carried himself with a dignified but unpretentious air, he had dark hair to match his dark complexion, likely set from the almost two decades he had spent at sea. He often carried numerous pistols, each tied to one end of long silk sashes, which he kept slung over his shoulder. <br><br>His tactical ideas were usually radical, but thoughtfully considered. He never jumped into any scheme rashly, though his ideas seemed almost suicidal to those unacquainted with his methods. Ultimately responsible for the theft of around 400 ships in his 3 year career, he bested every other pirate of the era by a factor of 10 times or more, although it must be said that at least half these boats were small periaguas and the like. <br><br>Roberts' boldest gambit by far was the theft of a fully laden treasure ship taken from a fully armed and manned fleet of 42 docked Portuguese ships. As the story goes, Roberts flew false colors, sailed among the anchored ships until he found a skittish officer to take hostage. Threatening the man with death, he asked where the most valuable ship was moored. When the young man pointed it out, Roberts sailed there, quietly commandeered the ship for his own, and sailed away without any of the other 40 ships being aware of what had transpired.<br><br>Roberts was not opposed to slavery, but he had a more open policy about African men working freely on his ship. Nevertheless, he did occasionally trade slaves too when economically necessary, and – most notoriously – he burned a slave ship with 80 men chained below deck simply because he was being pursued and had no room to take the slaves aboard.<br><br>Shortly after this incident, Roberts was tracked by British authorities to the West Coast of Africa, not many miles from where he had begun his career as a captain. Ambushed by those who wanted him dead, Roberts was reported to have dressed in his finest clothes before stepping out onto the deck of his ship, directly into a hail of cannon fire and grapeshot. In a flurry of projectiles, Robert's throat was torn out. He slumped to the deck, coming to rest against one of his cannons, and quietly bled to death.<br><br>His crew, believing he was resting, reprimanded their captain before discovering his true fate. When the realized he was dead, they picked his body up and tossed it into the ocean, giving him a proper sailor's burial and denying any British ideas to cart his body home and put it on display. Thus, with a quiet splash, ended the boisterous career of brash and bold Bartholomew "Black Bart" Roberts.

!*Born: Mid-1680s<br>Died: Summer, 1719<br><br>Benjamin Hornigold was likely born in Norfolk, England, although this has not yet been verified. All other information about his early life is unknown as yet. The first recorded instances of him are of his early exploits as a pirate in the West Indies around 1713-1714. <br><br>He was one of the earliest pirates to emerge after the end of the Spanish War for Succession, which gives us good reason to believe he was one of the many hundreds of privateers who were left without gainful employment in the ensuing peace. Like many other British mariners, Hornigold spent much of his time in the Bahamas, eventually settling in Nassau. It was from here he launched his career as a full-fledged pirate, though he likely thought of himself as a privateer – in his earliest years, at least.<br><br>A skilful sailor and strategist, Hornigold lacked some of the ruthlessness required to be a truly successful pirate, and until 1716, refused to attack English ships out of a sense of loyalty to his home country. <br><br>(Note: A pirate with a sense of honor... would make a superb hero, IMHO, if our edits to Edward Kenway don’t pan out. –JM)<br><br>(Note: Agreed, J. His lack of facial hair is a bonus. The beards on most of these guys look like owl’s nests. Ugh. –ML)<br><br>Hornigold continued pirating throughout 1717 and 1718, always with a mind on improving the situation in Nassau. But when rumors began circulating that King George I of Britain had issued a full pardon to any pirates willing to cease all illegal activity and retire, Hornigold took stock of his stagnant situation and considered it seriously. This angered his closest associates -- Charles Vane most notably -- who considered the pardon to be a cowardly surrender.<br><br>Then came the day of reckoning -- in 1718, Captain Woodes Rogers arrived in Nassau with a fleet of seven tall-ships and declared himself the king's appointee as governor. With a mandate to rid the Bahamas of all pirates, Rogers was not a man to be trifled with. Hornigold, who had grown quite sick of defending a republic few were willing to back, surrendered to the governor and took the pardon.<br><br>In the year following, Benjamin Hornigold grew to admire Captain Rogers and worked as a privateer for the Governor as often as he could, ultimately raising his reputation far above what it had been as a mere pirate. But when his activities brought him back into the sphere of his old friend, the pirate Edward Kenway, his seemingly good fortunes came to an end.<br><br>Benjamin Hornigold died under mysterious circumstances in the summer of 1919, somewhere in the western seas of the West Indies.

!*Born: 1680, England <br>Died: 1721, Jamaica<br><br>A common refrain in any biography of a Golden Age Pirate goes something like this: "Very little is known about this man's early life..." And with Charles Vane it's no different. We don't know where he was born, or where he grew up, or when he first took to sea. But maybe that's just as well, for it further heightens the mystery of this strange, unstable man.<br><br>Surely one of the most ornery and unstable of the "Flying Gang" -- the band of pirates who called Nassau their home for a time -- Charles Vane began his career like most pirates of the era -- honestly, as a privateer sailing for his King. Likely living in Jamaica in 1715, he was one of many aboard Henry Jenning's assault on a Spanish expedition to recover the gold from their ill fated wreck in 1715 off the coast of Florida.<br><br>Barely a year later it had become impossible to keep up honest work as a privateer, as British Governors were skittish about breaking the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, which called for a cessation of all aggression between the major empires. Having few other options, Vane sailed to Nassau where many of his former colleagues were now living.<br><br>Quick to anger and ferociously mean, Charles Vane quickly earned himself a reputation as a difficult Captain to sail under. At some point in 1717 or 1718. an old friend, "Calico" Jack Rackham joined his crew as quartermaster. The two remained partnered for some time, living and working out of Nassau with the likes of Benjamin Hornigold, Ed Thatch, and Henry Jennings.<br><br>When Governor Woodes Rogers arrived in Nassau in the summer of 1918 to issue the king's pardon to all wayward pirates living there, Vane was among those who absolutely refused to submit. After sending a snarky letter of complaint to Rogers, Vane and his mates sent a fireship at the Governor's blockade and slipped out of Nassau's harbor.<br><br>For the next few months, these homeless Buccaneers sailed about the Bahamas making homes of coves and inlets, trying to find a place to settle down. In November of 1718, Vane even sailed north to the Carolina's to meet with Ed Thatch, hoping to convince his old friend to rejoin the old gang and take Nassau back from British hands. When Thatch refused, Vane was out of ideas.<br><br>Weeks later, Vane was sailing back to the West Indies when a French brigantine crossed his path. Having ideas of his own, Vane declined to attack. This didn't sit well with some of his crew, most notably "Calico" Jack Rackham, who had come to loathe Vane's dictatorial captaining style. Shortly after Vane's refusal, Rackham and a number of those loyal to him mutinied, deposing Vane and setting him adrift in a small sloop.<br><br>Some weeks later, Vane found himself marooned on a small island somewhere south of Cuba. He spent many weeks in isolation there, though it is suspected he must have come in contact with fishermen who were known to frequent the area. But for whatever reason, Charles Vane kept to himself until he was able to hail a passing British ship. Unfortunately for him, the Captain of the ship recognized him as Vane, the notorious pirate, and refused to bring him aboard. More weeks passed, and Vane was at his wits' end. <br><br>At last another British ship sailed passed, and Vane clambered aboard. He did his best to keep to himself, but in a cruel twist of fate, the captain of the first ship happened to be aboard this second. He spotted Vane after only a few days at sea, and pointed him out to the Captain. Vane was arrested on the spot and sailed to Kingston for trial. <br><br>There he languished for almost a year in prison before his execution in early 1721 -- a sad, whimper of a fate for a man once so full of explosive and angry energy.

!*Born: 1692, Trinidad<br>Died: Unknown<br><br>Born to enslaved Ogoni parents in Yoruba, Adéwalé was sold to the owner of a prosperous plantation before his teens. He remained on this plantation, working the fields, until his mid teens, always scheming of ways to escape his predicament but uneasy with the prospect of living life as a fugitive. <br><br>Then fortune struck, giving Adéwalé the sign he needed. At some point near his 16th birthday, a group of buccaneers raided the plantation, robbing it of raw cane, refined sugar and as many reales as they could find. Seeing in this an opportunity, Adé grabbed a crate of sugar and hauled it aboard one of the longboats the Buccaneers had rowed ashore. Surprised to see a slave among them, the Buccaneers were nevertheless thankful for the aid, and welcomed Adé among them.<br><br>Adé sailed with this first group of men for many years, quickly learning the ways of a seaman, grateful for the chance to develop his own skills and chase his own passions. And though his life among buccaneers was not free of the usual bigotry of the era, Adé found the prejudice to be more confrontational than restrictive.<br><br>In 1715, misfortune struck a cruel blow when the ship Adé was aboard, struck a shallow sandbar near the port of Havana. The buccaneers -- mostly British at the time -- tried desperately to free the trapped vessel, but after catching sight of an approaching Spanish Galleon, abandoned ship only to be torn apart by schools of circling bull sharks. Adé made peace with his fate, and stood his ground.<br><br>Taken to Havana for questioning and inspection, Spanish authorities eventually decided to send Adéwalé to Spain, where they felt he would make an excellent interpreter, owing to his fluent command of Spanish, English and French. Some weeks later, they loaded him into one of the Galleons that made up their perennial treasure convoy, en route to Seville.<br><br>Thanks in large part to a hurricane, however, that trip never took place. With the aid of a young Welsh pirate named Edward Kenway, Adé escaped the bilboes that bound him. Freeing more prisoners as they went, Adé and Edward commandeered a Brigantine and set sail just in time to beat the worst of the storm. When the hurricane passed, Adé was free once more.<br><br>From that point forward, Adé sailed as the quartermaster aboard Captain Edward' ship, the Jackdaw. Operating out of Nassau for a time, they grew wealthy off their spoils and lived the lives they had always dreamed. But Adé was a man who valued the democratic ideals of this pirate community far above the spoils they acquired while living it. And as he saw Edward Kenway fall deeper and deeper into a spiral of selfish greed and pointless glory, he wondered if there wasn't a better alternative... a more noble cause he might adopt to suit his ideals.<br><br>In 1720, these very ideals were put to the test when Captain Kenway sailed to a meeting with the notorious Bartholomew Roberts. Adéwalé had never trusted Roberts, and had hoped Edward might come to the same conclusion before it was too late. Unfortunately, Adé's instincts were correct. In Edward's absence, Roberts' enormous crew attacked the Jackdaw, hoping to subdue her. Adé took command of the Brig and sailed her and her crew to safety, regretting the loss of his Captain, but confident he had made the right decision.<br><br>Some months later, Adé resolved to meet with Ah Tabai at the Assassin's village in Tulum. There he spoke at length with the old Mentor and asked him many questions about their Order. After hearing answers that pleased him greatly, Adé joined the Order, then set about devising a scheme to locate his old Captain.<br><br>Months later Adéwalé and the Assassins got word that Edward Kenway had been languishing for many months in a prison in Port Royal. They learned too that Mary Read and Anne Bonny had also been taken there. Adé and Ah Tabai put a plan in motion to rescue them. After the escape -- a tragic success -- Adé returned the Jackdaw intact to Captain Kenway, and bade him visit the Assassins as soon as he was able.<br><br>And in due time, Edward Kenway did just that...

!*Born: 1680, England<br>Died: 1718, North Carolina<br><br>Known variously by different sources as Thatch, Teach, Theach, Tache, Titche, Teatch, Tack, and more, we are fairly certain this Edward was born in or around Bristol and took to the sea at an early age, most likely in his teens. It is also speculated that he arrived in the West Indies quite soon after leaving England.<br><br>If this was indeed the case, Ed Thatch would have seen his fair share of the War of Spanish Succession, a protracted fight between most of the Empires of Europe that pitted Britain against royalist Spain and France. In these early years, from 1700 to 1713, he would have been a privateer or at the very least a merchant seaman, doing his part for the crown -- Queen Anne at the time.<br><br>But with the Treaty of Utrecht bestowing peace upon a troubled Europe in 1713, Thatch and his fellow sailors would have found themselves far from home and out of work. They thus turned to piracy as a means of sustaining themselves. In the ensuing years, Thatch befriended a Captain named Benjamin Hornigold and soon after joined his crew as quartermaster, at some point between late 1714 and early 1716.<br><br>Settling in Nassau, Thatch, Hornigold, and the rest of the "Flying Gang" as these pirates called themselves, began cooking up schemes far larger than most pirates of the era dared dream. Wanting nothing less than a country of their own, they worked to turn Nassau into a place of liberty and freedom for all who desired an escape from the bonds of imperial rule.<br><br>As Thatch's reputation as a worthy and fearsome seaman grew, so did his ideas about piracy. At some point in the latter half of 1717, having grown a long and frightful beard, he took to calling himself "Blackbeard", and worked at every turn to bolster his legend as the most feared pirate in the West Indies. Thatch reveled in the power of a good legend, and worked hard to cultivate his... frequently sticking lit slow-matches in his hat to raise a frightening cloud, or challenging his crews to endure long stretches below deck as burning sulfur clouded the hold.<br><br>After helping Hornigold take command of a number of vessels, Edward Thatch finally acquired a ship of his own in September, 1717 -- a vessel called "The Adventure" -- captained by the most unlikely pirate of them all, one Stede Bonnet. For two months, Thatch captained the Adventure, with Stede content to tag along as a passenger. But in November Thatch's fortunes improved further when he captured a massive French slave ship called La Concorde. Renaming her Queen Anne's Revenge in honor of his former Stuart Queen, Edward "Blackbeard" Thatch was now one of the most feared and deadly pirates in the West Indies.<br><br>For the next year he terrorized the West Indies and environs, before sailing north to the British colonies in North America. Here he frightened the inhabitants of an entire city when he blockaded the port of Charleston, South Carolina, in an attempt to acquire medicine for his ailing crew. <br><br>But shortly after this audacious gambit, Blackbeard decided he'd had enough of the pirate life. He was nearing forty and, despite his ferocious reputation, had lost his love for the pirate's game. In the early summer of 1718, he half-heartedly accepted a pardon from his friend Charles Eden, Governor of North Carolina. But by late August of that same year he had fallen back into his old habits, restricting his activities to the southeastern coast of the North American British colonies. Unbeknownst to him, the Governor of Virginia, Alexander Spotswood, was keenly aware of his continued piracies, and was busy organizing a party to "extirpate this nest of vipers".<br><br>In November of 1718, Spotswood offered money to Lieutenant Maynard to see the job done. Taking command of a few fast ships well suited to the shallow inlets where Blackbeard was known to hide, Maynard set off in search of his prize. He learned from passing ships that Blackbeard was likely anchored on the inland side of Ocracoke Island, an ideal haunt for a pirate. As dusk fell on November 21st, Maynard and his crew spotted Blackbeard's rag-tag group, but decided to hold off their attack until the tide rose. In the early hours of the following day, Maynard's crew slipped into the bay and approached Blackbeard's ship. They were greeted by a sudden volley of pistol shots and cannon fire. This caused Maynard to retreat, giving Blackbeard and his crew time to slip through the shallow waters and attempt an escape.

First as blend groups that allow Edward to hide in plain sight, and secondly as allies in the event of a scuffle. But remember to bring a bit of coin if you want them to fight along side you, as these pirates won't risk their lives for free.<br><br>(Why are these guys always standing around in tight huddles?

!*Born: England, Date Unknown<br>Died: ????<br><br>Of all the infamous West Indies pirates, Mary Read stands out as one of the most mysterious and inscrutable. No one is sure when she was born, with most speculation ranging over almost a decade, between 1685 and 1695. According to Charles Johnson -- a frequently unreliable source – her mother began dressing Mary in boy's clothes from a very early age, with the hope of passing her off as another man's son.<br><br>(Note: Not sure how this will play with average audiences. Have we ever done a market survey on cross-dressers? --ML)<br><br>In her teens, Mary evidently harnessed her skill for disguise to secure a job aboard a ship. Taking to sea, she worked her way forward until she found a position in the British Navy. Still disguised as a man, she saw action in battle, though owing to the conflicting reports of her birth, we cannot be certain of the battle. It was during these skirmishes that Mary met her first husband -- so the author of the "General History of Pyrates" claims -- a Flemish soldier who had evidently fought beside her.<br><br>But this union was not fated to remain intact, as Mary's husband was killed soon after their marriage. With few reasons to remain in Europe, Mary sailed for the West Indies. It is unclear what transpired in the years following, but it is almost certain that she resumed the practice of dressing as a man. We also assume Mary continued working aboard ships, improving her skills as a sailor and swordsman. By 1715 or 1716, it was likely she had visited her fellow sailors in Nassau, though perhaps not for the same reasons...

!*Born: 1688, Barbados<br>Died: 1718, North Carolina<br><br>Born into plentitude and wealth on Barbados, Stede Bonnet seemed destined for a life of pleasure and ease. The son of a successful and influential plantation owner, his early life was marked by tragedy when his parents died suddenly, leaving seven year-old Stede orphaned and in a perpetual state of melancholy.<br><br>His inheritance of some 400 acres of land softened the blow caused by the loss of his parents, and by the time Stede was in his late teens, he had already restored the sugar plantation to a profitable state. He married young and set about starting a family as soon as possible, but owing to what some called a "disorder of the mind" he never found solace or comfort in these domestic trappings.<br><br>To further complicate his unease, his firstborn son died in infancy, further amplifying his grief and stirring his restlessness. As a means of coping, he dreamed of going to sea and sailing about the world, meeting people, living life as a man free of the obligations thrust upon him...<br><br>(This sounds like an inspiring story. Would he make a good hero character? Or villain? --OG)<br><br>(No. Trust me. --ML)<br><br>At some point around Stede's 29th birthday, his restlessness got the better of him. Owing to "some discomforts he found in a married state" which brought on a "disorder of the mind", Stede decided it was time to take his first bold steps into the life he had always dreamed about. Using his considerable fortune, he either purchased a boat or had one built for him -- a small schooner he christened "The Revenge". <br><br>To maintain some semblance of the comforts he had come to enjoy as a man of means, he installed a full library in the Captain's quarters, and packed his wardrobe with all manner of finery -- silk pajamas, smoking jackets, and frocks. Near the end of 1717, his ship was ready. He bid adieu to his wife and remaining children and weighed anchor, sailing north from Barbados, hoping to reach the British colonies within a few months. He would never see his family again.<br><br>Now sailing under the moniker "Captain Edwards", Bonnet sailed about the West Indies looking for his first prize. Spotting a large Spanish warship, his crew foolishly encouraged an attack. After a brief engagement, almost half of Bonnet's crew was dead or injured. Miraculously, the Revenge was able to escape capture herself, and Bonnet ordered the crew to sail her to the only place he knew he could find refuge: Nassau.<br><br>It was here, in the pirates' infamous republic, that Stede met and befriended Captain Thatch, the infamous and capable captain who had recently taken to calling himself Blackbeard. Thatch managed to convince Bonnet to hand over the Revenge's reigns, leaving Stede happily confined to his cabin. The two sailed about as unlikely partners for some months, until Blackbeard took a far greater prize for himself: the Queen Anne's Revenge.<br><br>After keeping Bonnet's Revenge in his own fleet for a short time, Blackbeard suddenly abandoned her along with most of its crew. Bonnet was again free to seek his own path. Perhaps believing he had been properly mentored under Blackbeard's tutelage, Bonnet struck out for the Danish island of St. Thomas, hoping to earn a privateering commission. But his crew had other ideas. Plunging headlong into piracy once more, Stede's crew lashed out recklessly at every prize they could find, resulting in their capture some months later near Cape Fear, North Carolina.<br> <br>While Stede awaited trial, numerous people came forward as witnesses to attest to the good quality of his character. But this came to nothing, and after one botched escape attempt, Stede was finally walked to the gallows in December, 1718. As the hangman slipped the noose around his neck, he broke down in tears, begging for mercy. The sight of his abject shame moved many to tears, but it was not enough to save him. The "Gentleman Pirate" was no more.

!*Born: 1691<br>Died: 1720<br><br>Daughter of Emmett and Elizabeth Scott, Caroline was born in Bristol, England, to a prosperous family of merchants and civil servants. Given a modest education by her father, she furthered her own studies in her own way, taking time to read as often as her familiar duties allowed. Splitting her time between this and helping her mother manage her father's affairs, she grew into a confident and level-headed woman with more skill and intelligence than her situation allowed her to exercise.<br><br>Caroline first met Edward Kenway outside the Auld Shillelagh, in the aftermath of a drunken altercation. She had arrived to fetch one of her servants and there found Edward escorting the woman from of the clutches of one of Bristol's more notorious cads. Thankful for his kindness, Caroline agreed to a second meeting on more equitable terms, hardly thinking a romance possible. <br><br>And yet -- against most odds -- that is just what happened. Edward and Caroline grew quite close, and soon fell in love, quite much to the dismay of her father. Emmett Scott had already promised his daughter to the son of a wealthy East India Company executive, and made his displeasure apparent at every turn. But all his noise was to no avail. Caroline and Edward were married in 1712.<br><br>For a time it seemed as though this odd pairing might produce a lasting union. But Edward's deep love for his wife was offset by his uncouth habits and reckless attention to responsibility. Not content to live a life of middle class drudgery, Edward dreamed large, and fixed on the idea that he could sail to the West Indies and fight as a Privateer against the Spanish. Or, barring that, buy some land and sow a sugar plantation. Caroline tried to dissuade her husband, but to no effect.<br><br>At last his drunken antics and wild dreams strained their marriage beyond repair. To further complicate matters, Caroline discovered she was pregnant, and could not fathom Edward being a responsible father to their child. She resolved then to leave her husband and live again with her parents. Edward was hurt by the idea, but the shock of it did nothing to cure his fantasies. Instead he doubled down, and left for the New World, vowing to prove himself a man of quality.<br><br>Caroline had her child some months after Edward's departure, calling the girl Jennifer. In the ensuing years, Caroline lived a life that alternated between great joy and crushing grief. She had a beautiful daughter and a supportive mother, yet her father -- ever resentful for Caroline's defiance -- never treated her as a daughter again. <br><br>In  early 1720 tragedy struck with a slow but deadly force -- Caroline fell ill, and for many months languished at her parents' home, desperate to get well. Emmett Scott, believing his daughter's illness to be self-induced, did little to aid her. Unfortunately, the disease was all too real. Caroline Scott Kenway died in 1720 in her parents' home on Hawkins Lane, in Bristol.

!*Born:1682<br>Died: 1715<br><br>Nephew of the buccaneer Jean du Casse, Julien was born in Montpellier, France. He took after his uncle's example and took to sea at a young age, eventually joining him in a few skirmishes during the War of the Spanish succession. Fighting on the side of the French, and by proxy, on behalf of King Philip of Spain, du Casse's skill as a gunner improved rapidly, even as he grew wildly disillusioned with the monarchy and its obsession with lineage and breeding over raw talent and skill. <br><br>In 1704, ordered by his superior officers to join his uncle and hundreds of French troops in what would become known as the Battle of Vélez-Málaga, du Casse opted instead to desert his post and seek his fortunes in the New World. At first he threw in with slave traders in Africa, and for a year made a modest profit off the venture. But he was never comfortable with the cruelty and detachment the job required, and so departed for the West Indies in search of yet another vocation.<br><br>For the next 10 years, du Casse roamed the West Indies as a hired gun, working for whomever had the coin and confidence to pay him. Ever prizing the value of intelligence and skill over mere reputation and breeding, du Casse, eventually found his way into the company of Laureano Torres of Cuba, in whom he found a friend and confidant...<br><br>(Note: Can we say "Templar" here too? Why don't we mention this? --DM?<br><br>(Note: No mentions of Templars in this one. I have no idea why. Orders from the top. --ML)<br><br>By July of 1717, du Casse had earned Torres's full trust and was soon appointed as Captain of one of the Governor's largest galleons. Running guns, munitions, gold, and supplies for the Governor, du Casse gained a reputation as the Governor's hit-man... a cold and ruthless killer who would not hesitate to eliminate anyone who crossed Torres's path.<br><br>But in September of 1715, he crossed Edward Kenway's path... and the rest is unrecorded history...

He joined the Spanish army in his late teens, and was later appointed as the governor of Spain’s territories in Florida, a post he held from 1693 to 1699. He then returned to Europe to participate in the Spanish war of Succession.<br><br>In 1708 he was appointed as the governor of Cuba, a post he held for three years until he was accused of and arrested for corruption. He was acquitted of these charges, however, and managed to win a re-election bid in 1713. <br><br>During his time in Cuba, he made many lasting improvements to the city, fortifying the island’s defenses and kick-started the production of tobacco there. He remained Governor until 1716, after which point he retired and devoted his life to charitable functions, such as building hospitals.<br><br>(Note: Hard guy to hate with all these charitable outlets. Hard guy to like for the same reason. Dull dull dull. Let’s dig a little deeper on this guy. Maybe he has a secret fetish or mania. --RL)<br><br>UPDATED:<br><br>Though long since retired by the 1720s, Laureano Torres still commanded great respect and admiration from the people of Cuba. In 1721 he was evidently able to muster a few regiments of Spanish troops for the purposes of a secret excursion somewhere in the West Indies. Torres and his regiment were never heard from again, and though the official record hints that Torres died peacefully at some point in this year, newly collected evidence suggests an altogether different story.

!*Born: 1679, England<br>Died: 1731, Nassau<br><br>Woodes Rogers was born into money, to a seafaring family with deep roots in both Poole and Bristol, England. His early life was a picture of industriousness and ambition, and by the age of 18 he was an apprentice Mariner.<br><br>Upon his father’s death at sea in 1706, Woodes inherited his family’s prosperous shipping company, which he took to managing with great passion. Between 1704 and 1707 Rogers’ fortunes and family grew, and by the time he was twenty-seven his marriage to Sarah Whetstone had produced one son and two daughters.<br><br>By the end of 1707, however, his business had suffered great losses by raiding French forces, giving Rogers the idea to recoup these dreadful losses himself. Knocking about Bristol in search of a partner for this endeavor, he soon found himself in the company of William Dampier, an old friend and unlucky Captain who suggested setting out on a privateering expedition, one that would range far and wide about the New World. In 1708, Rogers made the necessary arrangements and set out as Captain of his own vessel, on a difficult voyage that would last over three years.<br><br>Along his course Rogers met with many successes and failures. In 1709, off the western coast of South America, he found and rescued a marooned sailor by the name of Alexander Selkirk, a sailor who had spent nearly 4 years living in isolation and who would serve as the inspiration for the book “Robinson Crusoe” just a few years later.<br><br>Soon after Selkirk’s recovery, Rogers’ fleet engaged an enemy vessel in open combat – a skirmish that earned him a pistol shot to the left side of his face and a mangled heel. Neither wound was enough to remove him from command however, and he continued serving as captain until his return to England in late 1711. To commemorate this return, he had an operation to remove the offending bullet from his upper palate.<br><br>(This guy is incredible! Can we make an entire film about him? --OG)<br><br>Now in poor health but high spirits, set about writing his memoirs. Upon their publication a few years, they were an immediate success, and proved a great source of income. But this brief glory was offset by the sudden death of his son, a tragedy compounded some months later by his wife’s decision to leave him. Also at this time, Rogers was sued by former shipmates for allegedly hoarding goods and money plundered from enemy vessels. Rogers assembled a defense, but lost the case.<br><br>In 1713, itching to return to sea, he organized passage to Madagascar claiming to be a merchant in the slave trade, but with the intended purpose of reconnoitering the rumored pirate colonies established there. When he arrived in Madagascar after months of hard sailing, he found that the legends of the pirate town “Libertalia” had been exaggerated one-hundredfold. The pirates in Madagascar were sickly and few and desperate for help. After spending just a few months here, Rogers set sail for England, a failure in his own mind... <br><br>And yet, never one to give up hope, Woodes Rogers reoriented his attentions to the West Indies... eventually lobbying King George for a commission to hunt pirates in the Caribbean. On this score, he succeeded. After a few diligent years of making his case, King George appointed Woodes Rogers as the Governor of the Bahamas. Now, at last, he would make his mark, and bring justice to a land where chaos had taken root… <br><br>Rogers arrived in Nassau at the head of a small fleet of half a dozen ships on the 22nd of July, 1718. Accompanied by Commodore Peter Chamberlaine, he spent the first day negotiating with the pirates living there, hoping to entice each and every man on the island with the King’s Pardon. Rogers’ hopes were quickly dashed by Charles Vane and his men, who blasted their way out of Nassau’s harbor with the aid of a fireship.<br><br>This minor set-back hardly mattered, for Nassau was now in the hands of the British, just as Rogers had promised his king, and a number of former pirates – Benjamin Hornigold among them – now sailed for him. Rogers set about renovating the city at once, first ridding it of its remaining rogues and rapscallions, and even going so far as to hang a number of men who refused the king's pardon, yet remained on the island.<br><br>But Roger’s swift initial success suffered an early complication when a huge portion of his crew took ill and died, likely of Yellow Fever. Another large portion of the soldiers who had accompanied him to Nassau departed with little warning for the colonies up north. And perhaps most troubling of all, Spain and England were at war again making Nassau a likely target for Spanish aggression.<br><br>He wasn’t wrong. In March of 1719, he got word that a Spanish fleet was on its way to attack his fragile town. Rogers had spent much of his own private fortune renovating the decrepit fort town, but he was still unprepared for a full Spanish assault. Much to his relief, the Spanish fleet turned away at the last minute and instead attacked a French settlement to the north.<br><br>Rogers served as Governor for three full years in Nassau, and though he did not suffer any more military threats after early 1719, his job was no less difficult. Dwindling finances and a general apathy among the population led to only modest improvement to the city. In early 1721 however, he caught wind that the King was unhappy with his performance in the fledgling community. Rogers decided to return to England to defend himself, but fell deathly ill before he could make the trip, and still later was wounded in a duel gone bad. Recuperating in Charles-Towne, South Carolina, for some six weeks, he finally left for England in March of 1721.<br><br>Arriving in England, he found his worst fears come true: he had been sacked, and a new governor had been appointed to run the Bahamas. Worse yet, he was imprisoned for defaulting on the debts he had accrued during his time as Governor – the same debts caused by the King’s refusal to fund his term as Governor. Rogers was eventually released from jail, and spent the next few years recovering from this slight as best he could, until the publication of Charles Johnson’s “General History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates”, which painted Rogers in a heroic light for his single-minded quest to rid the seas of pirates.<br><br>Propelled into the limelight once more, Rogers was given an excellent pension by the King, and awarded a second shot at his old job. Rogers returned to Nassau in 1728, a Governor once more… a post which he kept to the end of his life just 3 years later.

!*Born: 1682, Jamaica<br>Died: 1721, Jamaica<br><br>Of the few infamous pirates to call the West Indies his birthplace, Jack Rackham was born in Jamaica at the height of Port Royal's boom as a den of scoundrels. This would likely explain his atrophied moral compass, for he was frequently drunk, rarely serious about anything, and always chasing women. He used his outrageous and offensive charm to keep out of most trouble. But a strategist and fighter he was not.<br><br>Nicknamed "Calico" for his affinity for Indian and Asian prints, he was a terrible sailor and a worse pirate, given to flights of fancy and myopic ideas that served only himself, rather than solid strategic thinking. He was likely drunk for half of his adulthood, and had a weakness for women that trumped all basic needs, such as sleeping or eating. His disarming charm, dashing good looks, and his swift wit carried him far, but parties can only last so long before someone has to clean up after them.<br><br>After marooning Charles Vane and leaving his former captain with a small, shattered vessel, Rackham knocked about the West Indies for barely 2 months before returning to Nassau and accepting the King's pardon from Governor Rogers. Was it boredom that brought him back? Or the affections of a lady he sought?<br><br>Quite possibly the latter, for he soon found himself involved with another man's wife -- the fetching Anne Bonny, a woman 20 years his junior. When their relationship was discovered, Anne’s husband was so appalled by his wife's infidelity that he tried to have her arrested and whipped. Rackham offered to pay for a divorce, but the husband would not hear of it.<br><br>At their wit’s end, Anne and Jack decided to elope and return to the sea as pirates. Joining their crew was Mary Read, still passing as a man. Together the three set off in search of a fresh sip of freedom. But they did not get far. Within 4 months of their flight from Nassau, they were captured by authorities and brought to trial. Jack was kept in a prison in Jamaica, perhaps in a cell near his old rival Charles Vane.<br><br>A few weeks later he was hanged, and his body gibbeted just outside Port Royal on a small islet now called "Rackham's Cay".

!*ROBERT DE SABLE

Id: [0x00085FAD]
!*Noble of birth, noble in action, Robert de Sable rose to serve as Grand Master of the Templar Order in 1191. His tenure was short, but his impact was great. Fighting alongside Richard the Lionheart, he laid siege to Acre, and broke Saladin’s ranks. Dogged by Assassins throughout his tenure, he was ultimately martyred by one such nameless malefactor.

Id: [0x00085FAE]
!*RODRIGO BORGIA

Id: [0x00085FAF]
!*Roderic Llançol. Pope Alexander VI. A cleric and bon vivant by any name, Rodrigo Borgia served as Templar Grand Master from 1476 until his death. For too long, this man of faith and passion suffered under a smear campaign at the hands of his enemy, Ezio Auditore. Let him now be celebrated and remembered for his progressive outlook and focus on family values.

Id: [0x00085FB0]
!*MADELEINE DE L'ISLE

Id: [0x00085FB1]
!*One of history’s most overlooked leaders, Madeleine de L’Isle freed hundreds of slaves, and brought them to sanctuary in a tropical haven whose construction she oversaw personally. Brutally cut down at the peak of her career by Aveline de Grandpré, the orphan she rescued from a broken home, Madeleine served as Master Templar in the Southern colonies from 1764 to 1777.

Id: [0x00085FB2]
!*HAYTHAM KENWAY

Id: [0x00085FB3]
!*Suave, debonair, and clever, Haytham Kenway was a hero for a generation of men desperate for a decisive and charismatic leader. Slain by the ungrateful son who could not appreciate the wisdom of his pragmatic, race-blind approach to politics and personal life, Kenway’s tenure as Grand Master of the Colonial Rite ended abruptly in 1781.

!*Born: 1679<br>Died: 1715<br><br>Second cousin to Robert Walpole, Britain's "first prime minister," Duncan was raised in relative comfort and ease until his 18th birthday, whereupon he joined the British Royal Navy as a mid-shipman with dreams of becoming a full officer. His immoderate temper and his impulsiveness, however, stymied a swift ascension and he grew impatient with his progress. <br><br>After 3 years, his interest in the navy had dwindled to nothing. With his heart set on finding a post with the East India Company, he had a chance meeting with a fellow sailor whom he had come to respect and admire... and it was this sailor who introduced Walpole to the Assassin Order and all its teachings.<br><br>Leery at first, Duncan soon took to this secret order with a fervor and drive that he had not known in the navy. And as his skills increased, so too did his reputation. But his temper and impulsiveness -- coupled with a growing arrogance -- were always a liability, and he was known for his frequent clashes with the elders of the British Assassin order.<br><br>Still, he was a valuable asset to the Order -- so much so that in 1714 his Mentor asked him to sail for the West Indies, rendezvous with the Brotherhood there, and meet with their mentor Ah Tabai. Walpole accepted this position with eagerness and departed within the month.<br><br>The Assassins in England never heard from him again...

"I foretell a bright future for you, Lady Beth." <br><br>\\I like reading, drawing, and writing poems, but mathematics are hard. John Francis, my brother, is better at calculations than I am. He is one year older. <br><br>\\Papa wants me to get the same opportunities as my brother. He says I am fortunate, that not all young ladies have private tutors. I study hard to please him. <br><br>\\"We are fasting this evening, Master Kelley!" Uncle John announces. Papa grins. I know what this means: they will be working all night, again. <br><br>\\After dinner, I run to the parlor and jump on Uncle John's lap. His beard, unlike Papa's, is all white, and rough! I ask him to tell a story. <br><br>\\Uncle John makes everyone laugh; even Papa, who is usually so serious. He says they have to work now. Mama tells me it is time for bed. <br><br>\\I pull the sheets over my head and listen to the low, humming voices coming from the study. I am afraid of the dark, but not tonight, not with Papa and Uncle John praying.

How long will they be gone this time? <br><br>\\I ask Mama about Papa's work. She says he gives conferences with Uncle John, providing advice to people who need it.<br> <br>\\John Francis says Papa communicates with angels. I laugh, but Mama does not. "He told me!" he says, crossing his skinny arms over his chest. <br><br>\\After a long pause, Mama sighs. "John Francis is right. Your father speaks with angels. He gains..." She scratches her head, "Insight from them." <br><br>\\I ask Mama what an angel is. She says it is a being from beyond, a winged entity that lives with God, in Heaven. I do not know what she means. <br><br>\\John Francis says only Papa can call angels. Mama nods, saying he has a rare gift. "He uses a crystal ball!" John Francis declares.

Mama says it is because they have done good work. <br><br>\\I have finished my dinner and ask to be excused. Mama nods and I hurry upstairs. I notice that the door to Uncle John's room is ajar. <br><br>\\I hurry to the door. Holding my breath, I peek inside. The room is sumptuous! Uncle John always says Aunt Jane has good taste, and he is right! <br><br>\\I tiptoe inside and open Uncle John's armoire. It is filled with treasure! Shiny rocks, a black mirror, a wax seal with pictures on it, a gold amulet! <br><br>\\Ignoring everything else, I pick up what looks like a globe packed in cloth. Could it be the crystal ball John Francis mentioned? Quickly, I unwrap it! <br><br>\\The sphere is heavy and feels warm in my hands. It is made of the shiniest gold! On its surface, I see a reflection of my face and Uncle John s! <br><br>\\Uncle John grabs the sphere and puts it inside his doublet. I shiver, but he smiles. "You should not be playing with things you cannot comprehend, Lady Beth."

They do not eat; they are fasting again and spend most of their time in the study. <br><br>\\I wake up with a start and pull the blankets to my chin. It is still dark, but I hear voices downstairs. Taking a deep breath, I sneak out of bed. <br><br>\\I walk down the stairs, avoiding the creaking ones. I fear monsters will jump out of shadows though Uncle John assured me he banished all monsters from our home. <br><br>\\I tiptoe to the door of the study and put my ear upon it. I recognize Papa's and Uncle John's voices, but there is also another, much deeper voice within. <br><br>\\A loud click! They have unlocked the door! I hide behind the cabinet. Papa and Uncle John come out of the study and walk away, smiling. <br><br>\\I count to one hundred, then tiptoe toward the study. No one inside! "Elizabeth?" Papa says, behind me. "What are you doing?" <br><br>\\Papa makes me promise not to go into his study. "There are things in there you should not see." There are a hundred questions I want to ask him, but I can only nod.

He keeps to himself and barely addresses us during breakfast, but at least he is eating now. <br><br>\\I am feeble today. Mama says I have a fever and tells me to stay in bed. I sleep all day and most of the night. I awake famished. <br><br>\\I dislike the night, but I am not as afraid of it as I used to be. I get out of bed, careful not to make a sound. I do not want to wake anybody up! <br><br>\\A pale light emanates from the study. The door is open! Papa never leaves the door of his study open! I creep toward the light, on the tip of my toes. <br><br>\\I sneak a peek inside. Papa leans over a table, reading a book. It has an odd, silvery tint. Papa suddenly mumbles an incomprehensible string of words and numbers. <br><br>\\Papa sprinkles red powder on something upon the table. "I did it!" His wide grin deforms his face. "I did it!" He picks up a clump of gold! <br><br>\\Papa's guffaws make me shiver. His voice is deep and he speaks words I do not understand. I hurry upstairs and crawl back into bed.

I try not to laugh as they walk toward me. <br><br>\\Papa tells Uncle John that they should change the nature of their work, that they should study alchemy and stop wasting their time with angels. <br><br>\\They pass by the oak. "The book has boundless potential!" Papa says. "I need your help, to unlock its formulas!" I poke my head out. Uncle John frowns.<br> <br>\\"We could work at the imperial court!" Papa continues. "Producing gold is only the first step!" Uncle John turns to face him. I hide again, hugging my dolls. <br><br>\\"You should not fiddle with this book, Kelley!" I almost fail to recognize Uncle John's voice. "You cannot imagine the evil it contains! It holds more than mere numbers!" <br><br>\\Papa protests, but Uncle John interrupts. "Your associate, Master Husey, the one who gave you the book... I dealt with him before, long ago. He cannot be trusted." <br><br>\\Papa says they could be rich beyond their wildest dreams. I take a quick glance. Uncle John shakes his head. "No, my friend. The book will destroy you."

She has been avoiding his gaze. <br><br>\\I am reading when a loud clang makes me jump. Is John Francis acting up again? He can be such a baby sometimes! <br><br>\\Another clash, followed by a shriek; a woman's shriek! I put my book down and hurry to the door. Papa and Uncle John are screaming at each other! <br><br>\\I walk out of my bedroom. The shouting has stopped, but I hear sobbing now, coming from Uncle John's room. Is Aunt Jane hurt? <br><br>\\The door of Uncle John's room suddenly bursts open! Aunt Jane cries out after her husband, but someone interrupts her: Papa! <br><br>\\I feel the entire floor shudder as Uncle John slams the door shut. He glares at me, fire in his eyes.

I wish I could do the same. <br><br>\\I wake up jumping. Papa is screaming again! I close my eyes, wishing things would be as they used to, but I am old enough to know better. <br><br>\\A door slams. I look out the window and see Papa walking toward the stables, shouting, "Envious fool!" I watch him disappear in the darkness. <br><br>\\I run downstairs. Mama sits in the parlor, sobbing in silence. I crawl under the sofa. "It is time for me to leave." Uncle John's voice is filled with sorrow. <br><br>\\"You will be missed, both of you." Wishing Uncle John good fortune, Mama leaves. I stay hidden and watch Uncle John pace the room. <br><br>\\I quietly follow Uncle John to Papa's study. Producing a key, he looks over his shoulder and unlocks the door. "At life's end, you will understand, old friend." <br><br>\\Uncle John comes out of the study with Papa's strange silver book.

He is seldom home these days.<br> <br>\\People from all over the world gather here, at the "center of European culture", as Papa puts it. I wonder why important people frown so much. <br><br>\\Papa speaks with an elderly gentleman. His flowing white beard reminds me of Uncle John's. I sigh and take Papa's hand. He does not seem to notice. <br><br>\\"We do not dare walk the streets, the old gentleman complains, "even during daytime!" Papa nods, saying that Prague has never been so unsafe.<br> <br>\\"You know why, Master Kelley? The Emperor," he leans close to Papa's ear. "He is weak! He gives the people too much freedom!" <br><br>\\"I heard that a killer runs amok, targeting noblemen and alchemists!" There is a tremor in the old man's voice. "They say he is a monster. A giant!" <br><br>\\"Some say he is not even human," Papa declares. I squeeze his hand, wishing Uncle John could be here to banish the monsters of Prague.

The alchemists discuss at length. <br><br>\\Many alchemists agree: this killer, this monster, cannot be human. "What if it is a homunculus?" Papa suggests. A deathly silence falls upon the room.

I forget to breathe when it stops, two paces before us. <br><br>\\Mama trembles when the carriage door opens. A pale, emaciated man with a long, grizzled beard steps out. "Papa!" He walks by us, as if we were ghosts. <br><br>\\Mama has prepared roasted lamb, Papa's favorite, to celebrate his return, but he does not eat. He simply stares at his plate, silent. <br><br>\\Mama makes idle conversation, pretending without much success that nothing is wrong. Papa suddenly stands up. His chair hits the floor with a loud thud. <br><br>\\Papa storms out of the dining room, pushing invisible spirits out of his way. He shouts in a strange tongue; the same language I once heard him speak, when I was little. <br><br>\\My heart is in a knot, but I hold back my tears. I take Mama's hand, but nothing I can do or say will ease her sorrow. What will we do now?

He remains distant, but at least he does not completely ignore us though he works ceaselessly. <br><br>\\I walk through the open doorway of Papa's study, the platter Mama has prepared for him in my hands, and stop. Papa sits on the floor, and begins to howl! <br><br>\\I drop the platter and its content spatters across the room. I run to Papa and kneel next to him.

I close my eyes. <br><br>\\I cannot do it! Papa's voice is bleak, desperate. "Not enough... Not even a handful left!" I look at him. Tears run down his ashen face. <br><br>\\Slowly, as if revealing a priceless treasure, he opens his fist. In the palm of his wrinkled hand is a tiny bit of red dust. "Curse you, Dee!"

Papa walks toward us, his face twisted in a demonic grimace. He murmurs a prayer in the strange tongue only he seems to understand. <br><br>\\The officer tries to reason with Papa. Howling, Papa jumps on him, clawing at his face. A soldier strikes his head and he falls. Mama wails as they take him away.

!*Abstergo's archives contain a few references to men called "The Sage" or "A Sage", but they are few and far between. Each citing seems to refer to a different person living in a vastly different time and location. The earliest example was found on a Sumerian clay tablet in cuneiform script, while the latest survives only as a footnote in one of Laureano Torres's own journals, dated January 1704. In all -- according to Abstergo's existing research, seven different "Sages" seem to have graced the world's stage in the past twelve hundred years. But the real number is likely higher.<br><br>Perhaps, the strangest aspect connecting each of these various sightings is the fact that, in every case, visual descriptions of each Sage are remarkably similar. So similar, in fact, that one wouldn't be faulted for assuming they were talking about a single, immortal man. However, in two of the seven citations, explicit mention is made of their death and burial. Are we therefore dealing with some bizarre form of reincarnation? Or some simpler explanation that eludes us at present? More research is required.<br><br>UPDATE:<br><br>Thanks in large part to a series of letters acquired through the efforts of our researchers, we now have some sense of what constitutes a "Sage". <br><br>It appears that such a person, always a man, is the result of a bizarre experiment perpetrated by "Juno", one of the luminaries of the so-called "First Civilization," with the aid of her husband "Aita". Apparently using her husband's DNA as a base, Juno manipulated this genetic material to create a program that she then inserted as "junk DNA" into the Human genome. <br><br>Though harmless by all appearances, this program could -- under the right circumstances -- activate suddenly during the conception of a human child and, quite literally, reconfigure itself into the genome of her husband. In this way, a near perfect replica or clone of this man's personality and intelligence, with all its memories intact, would appear in lieu of the actual child that should have resulted from this union.<br><br>It is unknown at this point why Juno should have wanted her husband's likeness to continually recur throughout the centuries and millennia, especially in light of the First Civilizations swift extinction barely 100 years after Juno and her kind walked the earth. Yet it remains a sobering fact that there is a very high probability that one such replica of this "Aita" is alive and walking the earth at this very moment.

!*In 1712, Edward married Caroline Scott, a woman of slender means born in Bristol, against her parents’ wishes. Edward touched on the idea of joining a privateering fleet sailing for the West Indies with the hope of making war against the Spanish and collecting unchecked sums of gold. This, he told his wife, was their get-rich-quick scheme. Being a sensible and prudent woman, Caroline tried to discourage these ideas. Edward decided he needed to earn his fortune fast. He left for the West Indies one month later.

Id: [0x0008677B]
!*…in which our Hero took on Anne Bonny as Quartermaster, then began his provisional Training with the Assassins, agreeing to eliminate the three targets presenting the most immediate threat to the safety of the World -- Woodes Rogers, Laureano Torres, and Bartholomew Roberts;-- whereupon Edward first sought Rogers in Kingston and struck, wounding but likely not killing the man;-- whereupon he then sailed to Africa in pursuit of Bart Roberts, and thus finding him, delivered the killing blow and recovered from him a crucial piece of the Observatory;-- and from thence, he sailed to Havana in pursuit of Torres, using the Observatory Skull to locate him, yet finding only El Tiburón, the Templar's bodyguard;-- and so killing him, Edward sailed further to the Observatory, and there finding a disappointed Torres, killed him, replaced the Observatory's device, and vowed never to use it for ill;-- whereupon he received an old letter from Bristol bearing unsettling news.

!*…in which Edward Kenway dallied for a Time in Havana under the false Name, Duncan Walpole, whereupon he came into Contact with men calling themselves "Templars" named Laureano Torres, Woodes Rogers, and Julien du Casse;– it was from these men that Edward attempted to collect his monetary reward, and here too that he inadvertently joined the Templar Order, attacked and killed a sort called "Assassins", and met a strange man referr'd to as the Sage;– a mysterious Location called The Observatory was talked about with Reverence by all;– shortly thereafter, the Sage escaped the Templars' prison just as Edward's Deceptions were discovered;– he was then imprisoned and set aboard a departing Spanish Treasure Fleet for delivery to British Templars in London;– yet, using his Wits and Cunning, and accepting the Aid of a Trinidadian called Adewale, Edward escaped his bonds, acquired a Spanish Brigantine, and sailed away at the head of a Hurricane to Safety.

Id: [0x0008677F]
!*…in which we saw the Maxim "As ye reap, so shall ye sow" play out in full;– for it was here that Edward Kenway learn'd the Consequences of his Actions in Havana;– and here he discover'd the Allegiance of his Friend, James Kidd, to the Assassins;– and here he learn'd that the Maps he sold to the Templars in Havana named Assassin Encampments throughout the West Indies;– and here he found the Assassins were none too pleased with this Betrayal;– and in Consequence of these Actions, Edward was compell'd by Kidd's Mentor, Ah Tabai, to explore the Depths of a Mayan Temple, whereupon he spy'd a Statue of the so-called Sage, further deepening the Mystery of this Man;– after which Edward helped the Assassins defend their Camp against a Templar-funded attack perpetrated by the Slaver Laurens Prins;– whereupon the Assassins thank'd Edward, yet barr'd him from their Order.

Id: [0x00086780]
!*…in which Edward Kenway was reproved by Mary Read for remaining ever fix'd to the Piratical way of Life;-- and as such, sailed north to recruit Blackbeard back into his cause;-- and failing such, thereby resolved to drink with him instead, until a sudden attack surprised their Lot, resulting in the untimely death of Ed Thatch;-- whereupon our Hero rejoined with Captain Vane and Mr. Rackham to pursue his original quest for the Observatory;-- yet suffered a setback when a disgruntled Mr. Rackham raised a Mutiny against them both;-- and so set adrift on a damaged ship, our Hero found himself Marooned with Captain Vane, whose Sanity appeared in danger of slipping;-- whereupon Vane attacked Edward Kenway, forcing our Hero to retaliate in Kind, thus subduing his old friend and leaving him for Dead;-- after which time, Edward Kenway located a small fishing Schooner and slipp'd from the Island.

!*The Observatory seems to have been a surveillance device built by the precursor "First Civilization" about eighty millennia ago. Its cavernous ante-chamber was built as a security measure, while its long corridors were used to store thousands of crystal blood vials containing the DNA of those whom the First Civ wished to spy on.<br><br>At the heart of the Observatory was a large theater lined with seats. At the fore was a massive device like an armillary sphere with a crystal skull housed at its center. When loaded with a crystal vial containing a subject's blood, the observatory device would come to life, illuminating the room with a holographic projection of a real time feed from the subject's own eyes and ears. In this way, the First Civ could spy for an indefinite period on this subject and those with whom he or she was associated, without fear of detection.<br><br>Note too that the crystal skull can also be removed from its perch, turning it into a portable device, but also rendering the Observatory itself inoperable.<br><br>(Fantastic work guys! We found it! I'll send this data to Laetitia and see what she comes up with. I have no doubt she'll want to send a team down there as soon as possible. Likely for those blood vials, as modern day surveillance systems are almost on par with that crystal skull device. --OG)

!*Born: England, Date Unknown<br>Died: 1721, Jamaica<br><br>Of all the infamous West Indies pirates, Mary Read stands out as one of the most mysterious and inscrutable. No one is sure when she was born, with most speculation ranging over almost a decade, between 1685 and 1695. According to Charles Johnson -- a frequently unreliable source -- mother began dressing Mary in boy's clothes from a very early age, with the hope of passing her off as another man's son.<br><br>(Note: Not sure how this will play with average audiences. Have we ever done a market survey on cross-dressers? --ML)<br><br>In her teens, Mary evidently harnessed her skill for disguise to secure a job aboard a ship. Taking to sea, she worked her way forward until she found a position in the British Navy. Still disguised as a man, she saw action in battle, though owing to the conflicting reports of her birth, we cannot be certain of the battle. It was during these skirmishes that Mary met her first husband -- so the author of the "General History of Pyrates" claims -- a Flemish soldier who had evidently fought beside her.<br><br>But this union was not fated to remain intact, as Mary's husband was killed soon after their marriage. With few reasons to remain in Europe, Mary sailed for the West Indies. It is unclear what transpired in the years following, but it is almost certain that she resumed the practice of dressing as a man. We also assume Mary continued working aboard ships, improving her skills as a sailor and swordsman. By 1715 or 1716, it was likely she had visited her fellow sailors in Nassau, though perhaps not for the same reasons.<br><br>Official records of her activities do not appear until around 1720, a ship she had been sailing on was taken by pirates, who were subsequently arrested. In order to avoid a swift execution by Governor Rogers in Nassau, Mary took the King's pardon and there she settled. Whether or not this was a front for more secretive activity, it is hard to say.<br><br>It was at this time, however, that Mary met and befriended the much younger Anne Bonny. The two became close friends, as Anne reportedly saw through Mary's disguise rather quickly. Unfortunately, Anne's beau, Jack Rackham did not, and Mary was compelled to reveal herself as a woman to avoid a pointless altercation.<br><br>According to recently unearthed documents, we know that some of Governor Roger's administrators were eventually made aware of Mary's status as a woman -- likely on account of Rackham's big mouth. In any event, Mary, Anne, and Jack did not hang around Nassau for much longer after their meeting. At some point in the late summer of 1720, the trio raised a small crew and stole a Schooner docked in Nassau's Harbor. <br><br>For three months they pirated and pillaged, with Anne and Mary taking the lead whenever their self-appointed Captain Rackham was indisposed from drink. Unfortunately for all, Rackham's incompetence also landed them in more trouble than they could handle, and in October 1720 their ship was set upon by the British. According to reports, only Anne, Mary, and one unnamed young man were fit enough to resist -- and resist they did. Miraculously, only the young man died in the ensuing fight. Anne and Mary were arrested, as were Jack Rackham and the rest of his crew, after they awoke from their drunken stupors below deck.<br><br>Taken to Kingston for trial, their executions were stayed after the women announced they were many months pregnant. Mary languished in jail until her term was up. Unfortunately, just days after giving birth, she died of a severe illness or infection, likely caused by the terribly unsanitary conditions of her captivity. It is not know what happened to Mary's child.

!*3.3.1   Weapon and tools selection<br>Press [Dpad] to select the weapon and tool that you want to equip. <br>Press [Dpad] up and down to select weapons. <br>Press [Dpad] left and right to select tools. <br><br>3.3.2   Targeting<br>As you move around in the environment, you’ll notice that only some characters are highlighted; these characters are your ranged targets. Only enemy and military targets are highlighted. When a target is highlighted, you can perform specific actions against them, such as using a tool quick shot, or send group manipulation orders toward them.<br><br>3.3.3   Free Aim Shooting<br>With pistols or blowpipe, hold [LT] to activate the Free Aim Mode. It allows you to target any character at will. Simply move the crosshairs over the character you want to target and press [RT] to shoot.<br>Shooting with a pistol at an enemy's head is a lethal shot.<br><br>3.3.4   Quick Shots<br>Tap [Y] to perform a quick shot at a highlighted target. This will interrupt the enemy action and it should be used as a strategic advantage against enemies that are about to use a range weapon against you. Edward can craft a new pistol holster to perform up to 4 quick shots in succession by simply pressing [Y] repeatedly.<br><br>3.3.5   Reloading<br>You can reload any weapon by using [LB]. The weapon will also automatically reload if you try to use it and it is empty. <br><br>3.3.6   Weapons<br>Pressing [X] will use your currently equipped melee weapon. Your melee target has a stronger visual highlight than the ranged target.<br>You can prepare an attack by holding [X] as you run toward an enemy. When you are in range, the attack will automatically be triggered. You can use this technique to do fluid, continuous attacks without stopping.<br>If you select the hidden blades as your melee weapon, you will be able to assassinate 2 targets at the same time if they are in range. Additionally, the hidden blades allow you to perform stealth kills: if you are in Low Profile, attacking a target will make Edward perform a stealth kill which allows you to escape the scene before anyone notices what happened. If you are in High Profile (holding [RT]) your kill will be overt and witnessed.<br><br>3.3.7   Pick-up Weapons<br>Edward can pick up enemy weapons by moving over them and pressing [B].<br>Some weapons, such as muskets, have two functions. If you press [X] you will use the musket as a melee weapon; if you hold [LT] and then press [RT] you will shoot with the musket.<br> <br>3.3.8   Tools<br>Pressing [Y] will use your currently selected tool. Some tools require you to hold [Y] to deploy them.

!*5.4.1   Triggering a Boarding<br>When an enemy ship is out of health, its mast breaks and it goes into an incapacitated state. Approach the enemy ship to trigger a boarding by holding [B]. <br>When the boarding starts, your crew will throw grappling hooks toward the enemy ship.<br><br>5.4.2   Crew Fighting and Boarding Objectives<br>During the boarding, you need to accomplish a certain number of objectives in order to make the enemy crew surrender. Your crew will fight alongside with you during the boarding.<br>If your crew meter is depleted, your crew will retreat and you will lose the boarding.<br>Use the Swivel gun, ropes, and elevators at your advantage to reach your objectives and avoid the massive fight that is happening on the decks. <br><br>5.4.3   Boarding Outcome<br>When all objectives are completed, the enemy crew will surrender. You can then decide their destiny. You can capture the enemy fleet to add it to your fleet, salvage the ship parts to repair your own ship, or release the ship to reduce your wanted level. Whatever your decision, you will also steal the whole ship’s cargo and make it your own.

Press and hold [A] to walk faster; you will also gently push people out of your way while holding [A].<br><br>3.1.2       High & Low Profile Concept<br>It is possible to change the intensity of Edward's actions. By default, Edward will be in Low Profile, but his state can be changed to High Profile by pressing and holding [RT].<br>In Low Profile, Edward’s actions are inconspicuous and more socially acceptable. Fast and powerful Assassin moves, such as free running or tackling, are available in High Profile.<br><br>3.1.3   Contextual Interaction<br>Pressing [B] in front of an interactive object makes Edward interact with it. You can also pick pockets by holding [B] while in Low Profile.<br><br>3.1.4       Look<br>Use [RS] to look around the environment. Pressing [RSpress] re-centers the camera.<br><br>3.1.5       Eagle Vision<br>Press [LSpress] to activate Eagle Vision. Eagle Vision conveys information by highlighting environmental features. Eagle Vision is color-coded: red highlighting indicates enemies, white indicates hiding locations, and gold indicates mission targets.<br><br>3.1.6       Surface Swimming<br>Swim using [LS]. Press and hold [RT] to swim faster. Hold [B] to dive below the water surface in order to progress undetected.

When you are in half-sail, press [B] again to stop your ship.<br><br>5.1.2   Release the Wheel<br>When your ship is stopped and out of conflict with any other ships, hold [B] to release the wheel and go on foot.

Upgrades will require gold, but most of them will also require cargo to build them. You can find cargo by attacking other ships, then boarding and plundering them.

Through political manipulations and influence, Marla Capps has been undermining our war effort up and down the east coast for far too long. We need to take more drastic actions to bring stop her. Let us bring balance back to our side.

Id: [0x0008853E]
This war veteran has hunted many Assassins in the current conflict. His experience, leadership, and cunning have resulted in the loss of many of our brothers and sisters. Strike fast and hard, but do not underestimate him.

Id: [0x0008853F]
Greear is a downtown arms dealer who has betrayed our trust. He took payment for weapons we need but has repeatedly refused to deliver them. We aren't exactly sure where he's hiding yet, but you are to locate and eliminate him.

Id: [0x00088540]
Snider is a New York pamphleteer that has been troublesome for quite some time now. She has been stalking the HQs of our allies and eavesdropping on conversations. This person needs to be silenced.

Id: [0x00088541]
Maria Gurley is a very charismatic political agitator who is gaining too much influence in Albany. She has been ignoring our warnings and we cannot afford to lose the few allies we have. Make her into an example for the local population.

Id: [0x00088542]
Michael Crawley is a traitor to our cause. We thought him dead for quite some time. One of our scouts found him, quite alive, in a remote area. You need to remedy this situation. Be careful, he is a veteran of the Brotherhood.

Id: [0x00088543]

WARNING: Advanced memory. Full upgrade synchronization recommended.<br><br>French-controlled Labrador is not as strategically important as the island of Newfoundland, but the British still crave its rich fishing waters.

Id: [0x00089501]
WARNING: Advanced memory. Full upgrade synchronization recommended.<br><br>The Golden Age of Piracy may be over, but that doesn’t mean that pirates have been banished from the seas. A few adventurous criminals remain, less famous and in many cases less civilized than their forebears. Among the most dangerous operating in the far North are William Crest and Joseph “The Aristocrat” Reed. Though greatly different in breeding, appearance, and temperament, the pair have made a fortune terrorizing the trade ships of the North Atlantic.

It can destroy certain objects and hit multiple enemies as well. Why not try it for yourself?

Id: [0x0008A240]
Well done, Master Cormac... You should know there are also more subtle ways to handle business with the grenade launcher.

Id: [0x0008A241]
Consider these sleep grenades, for example. They will cause some heavy heads in a limited area.

Id: [0x0008A242]
SHRAPNEL grenades deal a lot of damage within the area while SLEEP grenades put enemies to sleep for a few seconds. <br>EQUIP a grenade using [Down], AIM with [LT], and SHOOT with [RT].

Day 1 of repairs: My Animus session triggered a virus hidden in the Shay Cormac file. I’ve been tasked with assisting two security contractors, Violet da Costa and Otso Berg. Violet knows her stuff, but what’s Berg’s story? Questions can wait, we have to work together to restore Helix servers.

Id: [0x0008A29B]
Day 2 of repairs: We still can’t get at the main servers in the basement. We’ll have to work floor by floor. I should help restore some computers and clean up some tablets. The sooner everything is cleaned up, the sooner life can get back to normal. Ha. What’s normal?

Id: [0x0008A29C]
Day 3 of repairs: Still no basement access. Fixed servers in CCO’s office. Had a chat with Ms. Lemay. I feel like she’s trying to tell me something about what I’m actually doing for Violet and Mr. Berg. There’s more going on here than I realize. Shay is the key.

Id: [0x0008A29D]
Day 4 of repairs: Finally restored basement servers. It all makes sense now. Mr. Berg protects us from the Assassins. I’m glad to have helped. Who knew that they were hiding under the skin of the world like parasites? The last couple of years working here make more sense now.

Id: [0x0008A29E]
Day 05 of repairs: What a crazy week. My eyes have been opened. I’ve been offered a place among the Templar Order, to continue the fight against the Assassins. I feel an obligation to accept, or am I just afraid to refuse? They’ve given me time to think it over.

Day 4: I finished researching Shay’s story. I think that the conflict between the Assassins and Templars didn’t end the past. In fact, I think it’s still happening and I’m in the middle of it. Violet and Mr. Berg seem happy with me. But should I be happy about that? 

Id: [0x0008BB56]
Day 5: What a crazy week. My eyes have been opened. I’ve been offered a place among the Templar Order, to continue the fight against the Assassins. I feel an obligation to accept, or am I just afraid to refuse? They’ve given me time to think it over.

Id: [0x0008BB57]
Day 3: Mr. Berg is really focused on Shay Cormac. Something tells me that the virus was meant to destroy or hide his story. I wonder how it ties into what’s going on here? I’ve been asked to fix servers on the CCO’s floor. Maybe Melanie can shed some light.

Id: [0x0008BB58]
Day 1: Abruptly pulled out of an Animus session by Violet, a security contractor. Apparently accessing the Shay Cormac file triggered a virus that’s affected the whole building. I’m still a bit disoriented. I should stick with Violet until I can find Ms. Lemay or learn more about what’s happening.

Id: [0x0008BB59]
Day 2: Melanie has asked me to work with Violet and Mr. Berg, security contractors from Abstergo Industries. Violet seems to know her stuff and isn’t afraid to crack the whip. We restore servers, fix PCs, clean up tablets, and deal with weird camera glitches. All this from one virus?

Having said that, I think we can we can use a lot of this data to present these people not as fictional action heroes, but as the focus of historical documentaries. <br><br>After a few iterations, we’ve come up with this as our best angle:<br>"Amid the chaos of the Crusades, one man's moral transgressions tower above all others. Experience firsthand what it means to be a remorseless killing machine in an age of philosophical turmoil."<br><br>These could be in a series, something like “History’s Hitmen?” haha, that’s turbo lame, but you get the idea. Or they could be standalone. Maybe this one can be “Murder in the Levant” or something like that.<br><br>We’re going to commission a few features using these controversial figures for Helix’s launch. Let’s see how they do and then we’ll discuss continuing the series or trying something else. <br><br>Thanks for your honest feedback, it’s always appreciated!<br><br>M.L.<br>

So maybe we can take him out altogether and create a virtual tourism feature? <br><br>Something like: <br>"Travel to the Italian Renaissance for a taste of fine wine, free thought, and filthy hearts as Abstergo Entertainment shows you the true meaning of enlightenment. Attend wild parties, witness spectacles unseen for 500 years, and rub elbows with the most famous nerd the world has ever known, Leonardo da Vinci."<br><br>I’m also considering a series focusing on some notable serial killers of history, Ezio certainly qualifies.

Exclusive to Helix, witness the rise and martyrdom of one of the American Revolution's least known heroes.

A quick fix option is to re-use existing assets and take a more family-friendly angle on her story: <br><br>"From a scrappy servant to a woman of dignity and poise, experience the heartwarming 18th century tale of a young Creole woman as she struggles to find her long-lost mother and heal the wounds of separation forever."<br><br>Additionally, “The Liberation of Lady Aveline” might open up some revenue from women, which is a demographic I think we have been ignoring for too long now.<br><br>M.L.<br>

Born: 1730<br>Died: 1757<br><br>Kesegowaase was born in Wolastoqiyik territory in what is now New Brunswick. Until his teens, he lived in a walled village surrounded by farmed fields, where he practiced hunting, fishing, and various survival skills.<br><br>As European hostilities grew, Kesegowaase joined other men from his village as mercenaries helping the French army. In 1746, he met Achilles and Liam O’Brien, who were working with the French Army on behalf of the Assassins. They were impressed with his prowess and determination and invited him to join the Brotherhood.<br><br>In 1749, he met Shay Cormac and became one of his instructors.<br><br>In 1757, Kesegowaase led troops against the English at the Siege of Fort William Henry. The English troops manning the fort had surrendered and negotiated terms that would allow them to retreat under the protection of a French escort. However, Kesegowaase and his troops ignored the terms of surrender and attacked the English prisoners, to ensure that the British soldiers would die. The violence was tolerated by Liam, who believed it helped accomplish Assassin goals.<br><br>(Hey Melanie! This story would make an awesome movie. –V.)<br><br>(It’s been done already! –M.L.)<br><br>(What? When? – V.)<br><br>(1912, 1920, 1932, 1936, 1947, 1963, and 1992. –M.L.)<br><br>(Then we’re about due for a remake, aren’t we? –V.)<br><br>Kesegowaase was killed by Shay in Albany.<br>

Born: 1726<br>Died: 1760<br><br>Liam O'Brien was born in Plymouth, Massachusetts, to Irish immigrants. After years of struggling to survive on a farm, the family moved to New York where his father began to work for a rich merchant, loading ships bound for England. Liam eventually joined him, and it was there he first met a young boy named Shay Cormac, who was visiting his father in the merchant marine. The two boys became friends and Liam looked after the younger boy, who lived in a rough neighborhood, and was showing a talent for getting into trouble.<br><br>As Liam continued to work, he was shocked to learn that despite all the profits made by their employer, the employees remained underpaid and mistreated. Tensions rose between the two sides. In 1736, Liam recruited a few of his young co-workers to begin robbing their employer. However, he was caught and was forced to kill a man in self-defense. In order to protect his son, his father took the blame for the murder and was executed by the authorities.<br><br>Lost, Liam drifted from one job to the next, distancing himself from everyone he knew, including his young friend Shay. He kept on robbing New York’s richer citizens so he could send money to his mother, whom he was too ashamed to face.<br><br>In 1738, he met Achilles, who began to give him small tasks to perform, such as delivering messages to a Wolastoqiyik man named Kesegowaase in the frontier. Achilles’ influence grew on him. He began to look up to the man who finally managed to teach him about right and wrong, and eventually, the Assassins and their Creed.<br><br>In 1743, Liam became Achilles’ first mentee, and quickly learned from him. Liam helped Achilles recruit the remainder of his colonial Brotherhood: Chevalier de la Vérendrye, Kesegowaase, and Hope. <br><br>In 1748, Liam found his childhood friend Shay Cormac, whose life was shattered after his father died at sea. Liam helped him get back on his feet and the two became inseparable. Later that year, Liam introduced Shay to Achilles, and it wasn’t long before his young friend joined the Assassins. Liam was tasked to keep an eye on the latest recruit.<br><br>Liam and Shay were close friends until the latter turned his back on the Assassins over the use of Precursor artifacts.  Liam was instrumental in retrieving the artifacts for the Assassins, and managed to kill the high-ranking Templar George Monro in process. <br><br>Later, Shay killed Liam to take back the manuscript.  <br>

Born: c1710<br>Died: 1781<br><br>Achilles was born of Caribbean and British descent in the West Indies. In the mid-1730s, he was the last Assassin to be recruited into the Brotherhood by its legendary Mentor Ah Tabai. When his training was complete, Achilles was sent North to establish a Brotherhood in the American Colonies.  <br><br>Achilles married a woman named Abigail and they had a son, Connor. Achilles established a homestead where his Brotherhood could settle before expanding throughout the frontier. He recruited several promising colonials, including Liam O’Brien, Chevalier Louis-Joseph Gauthier de la Vérendrye, Kesegowaase, Hope Jensen, and finally, Shay Cormac to the Brotherhood. Achilles strengthened the ties between the Brotherhood and the nations of the Iroquois confederacy, particularly the Kanien'kehá:ka.<br><br>Tragedy struck in 1755, when his wife and son died of typhoid. Achilles turned his full attention to the Brotherhood and sent Shay Cormac on a mission to Lisbon.<br><br>Achilles was stunned that the Precursor site did not contain an Apple of Eden, but even more by Shay’s open rebellion against him. After a fierce battle, Shay was left for dead. Eventually, the Brotherhood settled from the disruption, and Achilles believed that the Precursor manuscript had been destroyed, until he learned that George Monro was looking for it.<br><br>Achilles sent Kesegowaase and Liam after Monro. Kesegowaase reported that Shay was still alive and had saved Monro’s life. For his betrayal, Achilles made Shay a target of the Brotherhood. Shay killed Kesegowaase, but Liam managed to kill Monro and recover the manuscript. <br><br>Hope Jensen eventually reproduced one of Benjamin Franklin’s experiments to reveal a new Precursor site. Achilles and Liam traveled to the Arctic to find it. Once there, Achilles realized he was mistaken. The sites did not contain Apples of Eden, but Achilles believed they were of great significance and held the world together. <br><br>Achilles and Liam were confronted by Shay. Liam fought his former friend and their battle started a new earthquake. Achilles attempted to escape the site, but was intercepted by Shay’s new Grand Master, Haytham Kenway. <br><br>Achilles was beaten by Haytham, but Shay convinced the Grand Master to show mercy. Haytham acquiesced, but not before shooting Achilles in the leg, crippling him for life. <br><br>Utterly defeated, Achilles retreated to his homestead to live out his remaining days in wretched solitude.<br>

Born: 1731<br>Died: unknown<br><br>Shay was born in New York City to immigrants from Dublin, Ireland. His mother died in childbirth and his father served in the merchant marine. While visiting his father at the docks one day, Shay met an older boy, Liam O’Brien, and the two became friends. Shay was raised by his aunt in a poor and dangerous neighborhood, and Liam helped Shay learn how to fend for himself. <br><br>By the tender age of eight, Shay earned a reputation as a brawler, and his father brought him aboard his ship. Shay was always on the lookout for an adventure, and although he would miss his friend Liam, he eagerly agreed and began to work for a living. Shay began to train with a sword and pistol so he could join the crew in fending off pirates. In one such incident, Shay singlehandedly faced down and shot a pirate captain, saving his ship.<br><br>In 1747, disaster struck at sea when a storm claimed many lives of Shay’s crew, including his father. Shay returned to New York and spent his days wandering from one tavern to the next, starting one brawl after another.<br><br>By chance, in 1748, Shay reunited with Liam O’Brien, who helped him get back on his feet. After that, the two became inseparable. Liam introduced Shay to Achilles and learned about the Assassins and their Creed. He joined them a year later, and his training was assigned to Liam and his fellow recruits Hope Jensen, Chevalier de la Vérendrye, and Kesegowaase.<br><br>(Bromance alert. –V.)<br><br>As years passed, Shay grew increasingly resistant to the Assassins’ ways. He questioned Liam about the morality of their actions and the restrictions the Mentor placed on them. <br><br>Shay continued to obey until Achilles sent him to Europe on a mission to retrieve a Precursor artifact. The Mentor thought it would be an Apple of Eden, but Shay discovered, too late, that it was part of a system which he came to believe had been built to stabilize the world. Shay inadvertently triggered an earthquake that leveled Lisbon. <br><br>(Fun fact: We've been studying these temples for centuries and we still don't have any clue about what they do or why the First Civilization built them. Were they weapons in their war against humans? Were they another desperate attempt to ward off the catastrophe that killed them? –V.)<br><br>When he returned to warn Achilles of what he had discovered, the Mentor refused to listen. Shay tried to stop the Assassins and was branded a traitor, hunted down, and left for dead.<br><br>Shay escaped the Assassins and found himself in New York, recovering from his injuries. <br><br>(Hey, when you two are done with this guy’s genetic memories, can I use them? I think Shay’s story would make a great virtual feature! - M.L.)<br>

He followed in his father’s footsteps and was inducted into the Templar Order in 1720. <br><br>James Wardrop’s main task was to secure land and wealth for the Templar Order. Though the Templars were not yet officially established in the American Colonies, men like Wardrop were slowly but surely setting things in motion.<br><br>In 1744, he began to build a trade network for the Order that ran from the Colonies to the West Indies. By 1750, he was working with Christopher Gist to acquire land in North America. Wardrop endeavored to keep the fledgling American colonies loyal to the British government, but was not above using his position to line his own pockets.<br><br>Wardrop was entrusted with the manuscript by Lawrence Washington. Shay caught up to him in Albany during the Albany Congress and killed him.<br>

Born: 1692 <br>Died: 1758<br><br>Born to enslaved parents in Trinidad, Adéwalé was sold to the owner of a prosperous plantation before his teens. He escaped by joining a group of buccaneers who raided the plantation. <br><br>Adé sailed with this group of men for many years, honing his skills as a sailor. In 1715, he was captured by Spanish authorities, who decided to send Adéwalé to Spain, and loaded him into one of the galleons that made up their perennial treasure fleet. Thanks to a hurricane, as well as a young Welsh pirate named Edward Kenway, Adé escaped. Freeing more prisoners along the way, Adé and Edward commandeered a brigantine and set sail just in time to beat the worst of the storm. When the hurricane passed, Adé was free once more.<br><br>Adé became the quartermaster aboard Captain Kenway’s ship, the Jackdaw. Operating out of Nassau for a time, they grew wealthy off their spoils and lived the lives they had always dreamed of. But Adé was a man who valued the democratic ideals of this pirate community far above the spoils they acquired while living it. And as he saw Edward Kenway fall deeper into a spiral of selfish greed and pointless glory, he wondered if there wasn't a more noble cause he might adopt to suit his ideals.<br><br>In 1716, Adé first encountered the Assassins in Tulum. He returned in 1719, where he spoke with their Mentor Ah Tabai and asked him many questions about their Brotherhood. After hearing answers that pleased him greatly, Adé joined them. For the next fifteen years, Adéwalé faithfully served the Assassins. But in time, he became increasingly troubled by memories of his past.<br><br>In 1735, Adé’s ship was caught in a storm, and he washed ashore near Port-au-Prince. There, he met Bastienne Josephe and Augustin Dieufort, whose passion drew him to the Maroon cause. In the following years, he used his skills to help rebuild the Maroon resistance in Port-au-Prince. He fled Saint Domingue in 1737 after killing the governor, Pierre, Marquis de Fayet, and returned to the Assassins.<br><br>When Adéwale learned of the terrible earthquake that struck Saint-Domingue, he returned there to help the friends he’d left so many years ago. In the midst of the tragic loss of thousands of lives, Adé was met with two surprises: He was the father of Bastienne’s son, Babatunde Josephe, and that a charismatic and volatile Maroon leader named François Mackandal had created an Assassin Brotherhood in the region. <br><br>The Templars took advantage of the chaos to steal two artifacts from Mackandal and fled west. Adé set out after them, but not before promising that he would return to help rebuild Port-au-Prince, its Brotherhood, and his new family. <br>

In 1735, he went on his first expedition with his father to Fort St. Charles on Lake of the Woods. A year later, he re-established Fort Maurepas. He was rewarded with the title of “chevalier” (knight) from his father, who passed over Louis-Joseph’s older brother to do so. He spent the next four years exploring North Dakota and Manitoba.<br><br>In 1744, de la Vérendrye became a frontier post commander for the French government. It was around this time that he met Achilles and Liam O’Brien and helped them complete an Assassin mission. In 1746, Achilles asked de la Vérendrye to join him, an offer that was gladly accepted.<br><br>De la Vérendrye lost his father in 1749, and further explorations westward were disrupted by politics. Later that same year, he met Shay Cormac for the first time and took an instant dislike to him.<br><br>In 1752, De la Vérendrye returned to fur trading, but business did not go well for him.<br><br>In 1761 he planned a trip to France, but his ship was lost off the coast of Cape Breton.<br><br>(That’s how history remembers it going down, but we know the truth, don’t we, numbskull? –V.)<br>

She was adopted by a German couple who hoped to build a new life for themselves in the colonies. They symbolized this desire in the name of their adopted daughter: Hope.<br><br>(Barf city. –V.)<br><br>Years of hard work finally paid off for Hope’s father, who saw his business endeavors turn great profits, and her family rubbed elbows with New York’s elite. But despite their wealth and best efforts to fit in, they are never truly accepted in New York’s finer circles.<br><br>Hope received a good education from private tutors, and gradually realized that the world was unfair. In 1742, Hope’s adopted father disappeared under mysterious circumstances, never to be seen again. Later that same year, her father’s former business partners took control of the family business, leaving her adopted mother with nothing. Hope and her mother were destitute, forced to live on the streets<br><br>Hope’s mother died after a long and painful disease, despite Hope’s best efforts at stealing food and medicine. Hope vowed never to depend on anyone ever again.<br><br>(Fun fact: Life’s not fair! But I gotta admire this girl’s hustle. –V.)<br><br>In 1746, Hope met Achilles, who was impressed by her survival instincts, pickpocketing skills, and strength of will. She was inducted into the Brotherhood a year later. Achilles ordered her to set up a network in New York City, and before long, Hope controlled most of New York’s organized crime. <br><br>Hope was one of Shay’s instructors, though she often found him to be a hopeless student. The pair worked with Benjamin Franklin in an attempt to unravel the mysteries surrounding the Precursor artifacts. After Shay’s defection, she continued to work with Franklin alone.<br><br>Hope was killed when Shay attacked her in her mansion.<br>

Seven years later, he was placed in command of Fort William Henry with 1500 troops.<br><br>On August 3, 1757, Montcalm and 8000 French soldiers and Native allies laid siege to Fort William Henry. On August 9, Monro negotiated for his troops to be allowed safe passage to Fort Edward; they were allowed to keep their muskets and a single cannon, but no ammunition. But the Natives did not respect the conditions of the surrender and viciously attacked the prisoners.<br><br>(That’s the Brotherhood for you. We make rules, they break them.

The war rages on and Shay's Templar friend Colonel Monro finds himself outmanned and outmatched at Fort William Henry. But Shay comes to his rescue, escorting Monro and his men from the place. This respite is but temporary, though, as the Assassins recognize their prodigal son. They take up arms against him and any who would aid him. What is worse, the manuscript resurfaces, along with the possibility of a hecatomb. Shay stops one Assassin, but another  – his dear friend Liam – steps up to slay the Colonel. Shay promises he will have revenge against his brother. Inspired by the fallen officer,  he takes the oath of the Templar.

Shay and Haytham sail on in search of the artefacts. The Assassins are a step ahead of them, but not for long. Shay tracks down a former tormentor and discovers the Assassins’ destination: an Arctic island that conceals a Precursor secret. Shay’s former Mentor Achilles is there, along with Liam, the man who slew Monro. Shay and Liam had been best friends once, and shipmates… But no more. Their skirmish disturbs the very site Shay was trying to protect and lo! Another earthquake begins. With the temple collapsing around them, Shay and his former boon companion engage in a fight to the death.  When Shay emerges, he spies the Grand Master and Mentor locked in similar combat. Shay prevails upon Haytham to show mercy, and he does – more or less. The danger resolved and the manuscript retrieved, Shay can sail on to his next destination with the Order.

Months pass and what began as mere enmity between the British and French ignites into war. Meanwhile, the Assassin Shay hones his technique while cutting a swathe through the ubiquitous Templar Order. He murders Samuel Smith to get the Precursor box, and James Wardrop for the ancient manuscript. Along the way he improves his Morrigan and outfits her with fine weapons indeed. He also meets Benjamin Franklin, an inventor and political thinker of no little repute. With this man’s help, Shay combines the box and manuscript to discover a Precursor site of great power. But alas! When Shay finds the site, he triggers a calamity that destroys the city of Lisbon itself. With tens of thousands of souls on his conscience, Shay confronts his Assassin allies, only to be persecuted by the same. Left with no choice, he seizes both his fate and the manuscript and jumps to his doom.

Back in New York, the battle-hardened Shay searches for the source of both the criminal activity and its toxic weaponry. To great disappointment but little surprise, he learns that a particular woman from his former Assassin life, Hope, is in charge of both. He engages in a mission to turn the army against her minions, then must face off against Hope herself. She is merciless, poisoning him and leaving him for dead. But Shay fights off the viper’s venom and returns to the lady with a sting of his own! But, the dire deed done, our hero’s face is overcast with grief. Was this Hope perchance his Dulcinea? Alas, we may never know.

In New York, Shay awakens in the home of a kindly and venerable couple, the Finnegans. He soon finds that their existence is far from peaceful, however, as they and their neighbors are terrorized by roving gangs of ill-doers. But ha! They are no match for Shay and his uncommon skills. These same skills bring Shay to the attention of a certain Colonel James Monro, who shares his perspectives on civic duty with the young man. In more prosaic terms, he also asks Shay to rescue his Falstaffian friend, Christopher Gist. Shay regains his ship and takes Gist as his quartermaster. But he soon encounters his old ally Franklin, albeit under unfortunate circumstances: Franklin has been unwittingly helping criminals create dangerous poisons and weapons. Shay discourages Franklin and sets out to destroy the ruffians’ armament. Having done so, fate reserves a surprise for Shay: the Templars congratulate him on his heroic deeds! And Monro and Gist among them! With his life and soul in danger, Shay says nothing that might reveal his past.

Having attracted the attention of the Templar Grand Master, Haytham Kenway, Shay plunges himself into martial matters. To this end he befriends an English navigator, James Cook. With Cook’s help, Shay leads the Templars and the Royal Navy against French reinforcements for Louisbourg. They are successful – the Gallic fleet sinks in a raging inferno! That matter settled, Shay turns landward for an even greater prize: the life of the Assassin hero Adéwalé. Knowing this victory will shake the Assassins to their very core, he extinguishes Adéwalé, though not without regret.

Shay Patrick Cormac, a young man of ill manners but moral intentions, finds himself a member of those infamous renegades, the Assassin Brotherhood. This branch of the Brotherhood operates in the colonial territories of northeastern North America, as well as in the waters of the Atlantic. Young Assassin Shay helps some allied seamen  and gains a shabby vessel of his own, the Morrigan. Back at the Assassin homestead, he receives some training from his compatriots, of which he was in dire need. Shay then learns from the heroic Adéwalé that a terrible earthquake has struck Haiti, with thousands of souls lost. What is more, during the disaster the Templars absconded with two crucial artifacts, a box and a manuscript. The Mentor Achilles tasks Shay and his brothers with retrieving these valuables, which he believes can bring the Assassins to dominance. Following a tip from a French spy, Shay takes the life of one Lawrence Washington in the search for these peculiar items. Little does he know that his quest has barely begun…

This is the fastest speed you can go; if you encounter enemies or sea hazards, you will automatically transition to full sail speed.<br><br>You can lower your ship’s speed by pressing [B].

When you are in half-sail, press [B] again to stop your ship.<br><br>5.1.2     Release the wheel<br>When your ship is stationary and out of conflict with any other ships, holding [B] will release the wheel and let the player continue on foot.

5.3.1     Aiming <br>The weapon selected during a naval fight varies depending on the direction in which you are looking. Move the camera with [MM] to select between the front, sides, and rear of your ship. Note that over time you will have the opportunity to gain new weapons.<br>Hold [LT] to activate Aiming Mode. During Aiming Mode you can adjust the projectile trajectory up or down and adjust where to shoot by using [MM].<br><br>5.3.2     Broadside cannons<br>Orient your camera to the side until your broadside cannons are highlighted and hold [LT] to enter aiming mode. Tap or hold [RT] to fire your basic round shots.<br>Round shot doesn't deal much damage, but the ammunition supply is unlimited. The longer you hold [LT], the more precise your shot is, and more projectiles will hit the target. <br><br>5.3.3     Bow carronade<br>Look forward and press [RT] to with the bow carronades. These cannons can stun enemy ships and stop their movement for a brief moment. You can also enter aiming mode by holding [LT] for more precise shots.<br><br>5.3.4     Heavy shot<br>Orient your camera to the side until your broadside cannons are highlighted and tap [RT] to fire your Heavy Shot rounds. Heavy shot deals heavy damage to enemy ships. However, it has a shorter range and limited ammunition capacity.<br><br>5.3.5     Burning oil<br>Orient your camera toward the rear of your ship and tap [RT] to release burning oil. Burning oil will float on water and cause damage to the enemy ships that sail into it. It is a great chase breaker when enemy ships are pursuing you. You can also enter aiming mode by holding [LT] to release the burning oil. The amount of burning oil you can carry is limited by your storage capacity.<br><br>5.3.6     Mortar<br>Hold [LB] to enter aim with the mortars. Press [RT] to fire the mortars. The mortars deal heavy damage, and they are also a very long-range weapon that allow you to attack enemies from a distance. The mortar ammunition capacity is limited.<br><br>5.3.7     Puckle gun<br>Hold [RB] and aim with [MM] to use the Puckle gun. The Puckle gun is a rapid-fire weapon that deals low damage, but is very effective when targeting the weak points of targeted ships. It can also be used to destroy fire barrels from a distance. The Puckle gun has an unlimited ammo capacity.<br>The Puckle gun can also be used during a boarding sequence to shoot at enemies on the enemy ship. <br><br>5.3.8     Bracing<br>When you are under enemy fire, or about to be hit by a rogue wave, hold [X] to brace and put your crew into cover. For a short time you will receive reduced damage. Once used, this ability will be unavailable for a very short time while your crew recovers and takes a breath. This is an important tactic to master during naval battles.<br><br>5.3.9     Ramming<br>With a ramming upgrade equipped, your ship can dash straight into enemy ships to deal damage. Watch out as some enemies might use the same strategy.<br>You can also use a special ramming speed if you have a ram equipped. In order to do that, look to the front of your ship, hold [LT], and then press [A].

!*Greetings, Privateer. A grave Injustice has been perpetrated against me and my Company. The Spanish fleet has boarded and commandeered one of my Frigates. All I ask of you is that you rectify the situation: board and capture the San Lorenzo and I will be most grateful. Signed: Milo Van Der Graaff, Honest Businessman and Friend.

Id: [0x00989F9E]
!*Greetings, Privateer. A villainous Spanish Captain is responsible for slaying a Number of my Employees most brutally and callously. Board his ship and put an End to his Life so that others may be spared such a Fate. Signed: Milo Van Der Graaff, Honest Businessman and Friend.

Id: [0x00989F9F]
!*Greetings, Privateer. A Plague of Spanish Ships confounds the pleasant Waters my merchant Vessels navigate in the name of Freedom and good Will. Rid the Sea of this Menace and the Van Der Graff Company will reward you handsomely. Signed: Milo Van Der Graaff, Honest Businessman and Friend.

Id: [0x00989FA0]
!*Greetings, Privateer. A Spanish Ship has appropriated some prized Resources from their rightful Owner. Though I have mislaid the Documents that prove this, I contend that rightful Owner to be me.

Id: [0x00989FA1]
!*Greetings, Privateer. News has reached me of highly illicit Merchandise being carried over the Ocean. Find this Cargo and I shall ensure it is disposed of in a safe and proper Manner. Signed: Milo Van Der Graaff, Honest Businessman and Friend.

Id: [0x00989FA2]
!*Greetings, Privateer. It is time to take a Stand against those Spanish Contrabandists. Though they claim to be operating under Orders of the Spanish Crown, there are various ships carrying smuggled Goods of a most pernicious Nature. Will you help me end their tyranny? Signed: Milo Van Der Graaff, Honest Businessman and Friend.

Id: [0x00989FA3]
!*Greetings, Privateer! We have captured a Ship carrying valuable Cargo which is rightfully ours. The Spanish do not agree with this Assessment and have vowed to take it back. Protect the Ship and you will be amply rewarded. Signed: Milo Van Der Graaff, Honest Businessman and Friend.

Id: [0x00989FA4]
!*Greetings, Privateer. You have been afforded the rare Chance of being the Instrument of Righteousness and Justice. A Criminal masquerading as a Captain sails aboard a British Man O’ War.

Id: [0x00989FA5]
!*Greetings, Privateer. I must record a sad Day upon the Calendar, for it is to be my last as an active Merchant. Circumstances have forced me into Retirement, though I do not believe my Enemies will allow me to withdraw without a Fight. I plead for your Assistance as I fear both the Spanish and the British will soon be upon me. Signed: Milo Van Der Graaff, former Honest Businessman and constant Friend.

Id: [0x00989FA6]
!*Greetings, Privateer. I am but a simple Merchant, yet at times even Merchants must wage War. I have engaged the Services of various Privateers to sink a Fleet of so-called Spanish Traders, who are in Reality nothing more than Pirates. Join our Ranks and may this be a glorious Battle. Signed: Milo Van Der Graaff, Honest Businessman and Friend.

Id: [0x00989FA7]
!*Greetings, Privateer. Britain once again proves itself the enemy of international free Trade. Their so-called Pirate Hunters have sunk many fine and innocent Vessels and must be punished. Attract their Attention using whichever Methods you deem suitable, and destroy them. Signed: Milo Van Der Graaff, Honest Businessman and Friend.

Id: [0x00989FA8]
!*Greetings, Privateer. The HMS Courage is carrying Documents that would implicate legitimate Businessmen such as myself in unlawful Activities. The Documents are of course false, but they should be destroyed nonetheless. I trust I can leave this delicate Matter in your Hands. Signed: Milo Van Der Graaff, Honest Businessman and Friend.

Id: [0x00989FA9]
!*Greetings, Privateer! I am currently engaged in a most lucrative Transaction with a Spanish Governor, but there is a British Fleet under the Misapprehension that the Goods in question belong to them. I would be eternally grateful if you could show them the Error of their Ways. Signed: Milo Van Der Graaff, Honest Businessman and Friend.

Id: [0x00989FAA]
!*Greetings, Privateer. This is a black Day for Liberty. One of my Warehouses, located, it is true, in what was once a Smuggler’s den, is being blockaded by a Spanish Fleet.

1738<br>Anto,<br><br>I reject your offer of help. I have recruited my own Brotherhood, liberated from plantations. My faithful acolytes are all I need. They are willing to die for our cause. <br><br>I reject your calls for peace. There will be no peace while the French continue to spread across Saint-Domingue like a plague. What would you know of peace, raised by such a soft Mentor as Ah Tabai? If I found a Precursor relic, I would not destroy it! I would use it as early and often as possible.<br><br>My knowledge of the Brotherhood comes from its source. “Laa shay'a waqi'un moutlaq bale kouloun moumkine.” I understand these words in a way you never will. My Creed is pure, undiluted by centuries of weakness and compromise. <br><br>If your so-called Assassins oppose me, they may possibly die. If your so-called Maroons join me, the will surely die. All things end in death. It may as well be French deaths.<br><br>François Mackandal<br>Port-au-Prince<br>

1740<br>Mentor,<br><br>I have arrived in the British colonies to the North. While it saddens me to know that I will never see you again, nor benefit from your wise counsel, I look forward to the challenge of creating a Brotherhood here that will rival the one you created in Tulum.<br><br>However, I have encountered the unexpected: I am not the first Assassin to walk these lands. I have met a man called John de la Tour, from a powerful and established family in Acadia, to the North. He claims to be receiving instructions from the Assassin Council in France. <br><br>De la Tour is attempting to build a network of information, with the intention of more easily identifying any potential threats to the Colonies. He has a theory that the New World likely contains Precursor sites and artefacts. And while I suppose the Templars will eventually arrive here to siphon off a share of the natural resources, should a remnant of Those Who Came Before reveal itself, then they would descend upon the Colonies like thunder. John intends to discover them first while building a Brotherhood to protect them. <br><br>John de la Tour is brash, he draws attention to himself, and for a time, I thought he would surely compromise the Brotherhood. But I was wrong. He misdirects with charm, he hides in plain sight behind a smile. The people know that he is rich and that he is dangerous, but they never get a moment to question why.  Still, he is unbelievably arrogant. I like him, but I do not trust him. I wonder if we will be able to work together.<br><br>Your disciple,<br>Achilles<br>Norfolk, Virginia<br>

1742<br>Grand Master,<br><br>I was unable to find any Precursor sites in the Orient. However, I believe I may have picked up the trail of an artefact thought lost for centuries. The Assassin known as Shao Jun possessed a type of Precursor box, rumoured to contain a strange power. The box remained in China for about a hundred years after her death. I believe that the Assassins secreted the artefact out of China via the Manila Galleons bound for Acapulco. <br><br>It will probably be found in the West Indies somewhere. That will be a difficult part of the world for us to infiltrate, as it has been firmly under the control of the Assassins since the murder of Grand Master Torres. <br><br>Perhaps if we were to provoke the rivalry between the many European empires, we could search for it under the cover of war?<br><br>May the Father of Understanding guide you.<br>John Harrison<br>Manila<br>

1738<br>Master Washington,<br><br>Three years ago I obtained a journal from Edward Kenway. Inspired by his discovery of the Observatory, he dedicated many years of his life to seeking out other First Civilization sites.<br><br>He found several vaults in Italy, of which we are already aware. There was a hollowed-out temple in Alamut. But the most interesting parts of the journal were his suspicions that something was hidden in the New World, a location so grand that it would make the Observatory seem like a latrine.<br><br>I want this grand temple. I have set it as my Order’s highest priority and I am using every asset at my disposal. I am reaching out to Rites across the world. Whatever it contains, be it technology or knowledge, I will use to usher in a new age of peace.<br><br>As a Master Templar, you have learned your lessons well, and have earned this opportunity. You are my eyes and ears in the New World now. Do not fail me, Lawrence.<br><br>May the Father of Understanding guide you.<br>Reginald Birch<br>

1744<br>Mentor,<br><br>I have followed John de la Tour to his homeland in the North. The weather does not agree with me, as I am too used to the climate of the West Indies. But I will not let this arrogant bastard know how much I suffer. <br><br>We arrived in Québec to find Mathieu Léveillé, a slave from Martinique who was purchased by the French government to serve as executioner. He was said to possess certain knowledge of the First Civilization. But we were too late. The cold weather took its toll on the poor man and he died from an illness last September. <br><br>But all was not lost. To cure Léveillé’s depression, the government procured him a wife from the West Indies. As the marriage could no longer take place, she was put up for sale. John de la Tour, acting on instinct, bought her. And he was right. Though she was scarcely allowed to be in her intended’s presence due to the fear of infection, the executioner gave her his most trusted secrets and she promised to keep them safe.<br><br>I asked for her name. She told me that she had just been baptized Angelique-Denise, and before that, she had another name given to her by another master. I told her that as she no longer had a master, her freedom would begin by choosing a name for herself. She laughed – she has the most delightful laugh! – then she told me that her name was Abigail. <br><br>I have changed my mind about John de la Tour. <br><br>Your disciple,<br>Achilles<br>Québec<br>

1745<br>Mentor,<br><br>I am sorry to hear of your failing health. I only hope this letter reaches you in time. <br><br>We arrived at Louisbourg in search of a safe house belonging to Nicolas Court, distantly related to Antoine Court, the religious leader of the Huguenots. Nicolas is a Hermeticist studying the mythology of the indigenous peoples of the New World. De La Tour believed that he had information leading to Precursor sites.<br><br>Abigail and I travelled with him, posing as his slaves. The subterfuge made my blood boil, but it made de La Tour appear phenomenally wealthy, which opened up many doors that would otherwise have needed to be forced open by more violent means. Abigail soothed my temper and we spoke often about the strange journeys our lives had taken up until that point. <br><br>We were running out of time. The wars in Europe have spilled over into the New World, and English troops descended on Louisbourg. John and I attempted to reach out to the French government, but they chose not to augment Louisbourg’s defences, as they realized they could reclaim their losses in treaty negotiations. Efficiency measured in human lives. John and I did what we could to prepare, while Abigail searched the city for the safe house.  <br><br>Finally, time ran out. John presented me with his Assassin robes. He said that the Templars would surely be on their way, if they were not already in the New World, and that the time to establish a Brotherhood was now. He shook my hand, called me “Mentor,” and then left the fortress to attack the invading British troops alone to buy me time to complete our mission. <br><br>Abigail found the safe house. It was empty, as though Nicolas Court knew we were coming. <br><br>The only thing left was a note saying “SEEK OUT THE SKY WOMAN.” <br><br>I must leave Acadia. The Sky Woman is a myth of the Iroquois, and so Abigail and I will flee to New York, and I will, at last, begin to build my Brotherhood.<br><br>I hope your remaining days are comfortable and free of pain, Ah Tabai. Thank you for everything you have given me. I will never forget you.<br><br>Your disciple,<br>Achilles<br>Louisbourg<br>

You will soon be granted a position in the naval bureaucracy, and I will make use of what passes for your administrative skills. They certainly surpass your skills as a naval officer.

While on the surface it appears to be its rampant imperialism at play, we suspect its ultimate cause is the Templar Order. It seems their Grand Master is becoming increasingly obsessed with the legends of the Precursor race.

While on the surface, my task is to assist the Count with writing a book on the Holy Roman Empire, I will be penetrating said 40,000 volumes for anything which can help the Grand Master locate any Precursor sites or relics of power.<br><br>What a marvellous idea this First Civilization is! And what a bold vision Grand Master Birch has. I have long believed that the only way for us to become great is to emulate the ancients. However, when I first came up with that thought, I was referring to the Greeks and Romans. But if we could be like Those Who Came Before, there would surely be no stopping us. I wonder what kind of art the First Civilization created. Did they have music? What did they consider to be beautiful? <br><br>But now, to the point of my correspondence. Should you discover any tomes related to the history and mythology of the indigenous people that surround you, please send a copy to yours truly, so that I may add them to my research? How I wish I could publish a book about the Precursors. They are my new, albeit secret, obsession.

The water animals lifted their heads and looked up in wonder at the glowing woman in the sky. "What will happen when she reaches the water?" they asked one another.

Id: [0x013132BB]
All the animals dove as deep as they could to find land. None could hold their breath long enough until finally, Muskrat brought up a little bit of earth in his paws.

Id: [0x013132BC]
A great turtle arrived, and Muskrat put the earth on his back. The turtle grew and the earth multiplied until they became a great island, which men now call North America.

Id: [0x013132BD]
From beneath the water, the swans flew up to meet The Sky Woman. They caught her and carefully set her down upon the new land.

Id: [0x013132BE]
The Sky Woman thanked the animals. "Now I can give this land spirit," she said. She then gave birth to twin sons.

Id: [0x013132BF]
The son who was born first was born laughing, and was called the Good Spirit. The son who was born second caused the Sky Woman so much pain that she died. He was called the Evil Spirit.

The End and Beyond

Id: [0x013132CC]
The Good Spirit grieved for his mother. But he took her eyes and raised them into the sky, so one could become the sun and the other the moon. Her tears became the stars. This way, the world would no longer be in darkness.

Id: [0x013132CD]
The Good Spirit buried what was left of his mother under the earth to nourish the soil. All the trees and plants would grow out of her.

Id: [0x013132CE]
Meanwhile, while the Good Spirit worked in the light, the Evil Spirit did mischief within the shadows.

Id: [0x013132CF]
The Evil Spirit crossed the land, moving from shadow to shadow. "I will ruin everything my brother has made!" he said.

Id: [0x013132D0]
And so, when the Good Spirit made strong trees and swift deer, the Evil Spirit made poisonous berries and stinging insects.

Id: [0x013132D1]
Finally, the Good Spirit took red clay from the earth and made humans. He taught humans how to speak and live together. The jealous Evil Spirit made himself servants out of sea foam.

Id: [0x013132D2]
The Good Spirit saw that his creations heeded his words, and were capable of wisdom. He wished that they might live forever in harmony.

Id: [0x013132D3]
The Good Spirit saw the mischief that his brother did and knew that even his help would not be enough. He told his brother to stop making trouble, but the Evil Spirit refused.

Id: [0x013132D4]
Knowing that his brother would respect only violence, the Good Spirit reluctantly challenged the Evil Spirit to combat. The winner would rule the world.

Id: [0x013132D5]
The Good Spirit and his people united and triumphed over the Evil Spirit. He banished his brother to a cave beneath the earth.

Id: [0x013132D6]
On the surface, though, some of the Evil Spirit’s servants still wandered from shadow to shadow. Their influence causes men to do evil things.

Id: [0x013132D7]
This is why there is still evil in the world. But people can also cast out this evil and find the good spirit within. All people can choose the path they follow.

Anticosti Island

Id: [0x02626168]
The French explorer Jacques Cartier was the first European to discover Anticosti, in 1534. He originally named it Isle d’Assomption, as well as declaring it a strange and cursed island. However, by the 17th century it was referred to as Anticosti, in an attempt to mimic the name used by the indigenous people of the area.<br><br>Although historically more of a hunting ground than anything else, the island was settled in 1680, when King Louis XIV of France handed it over to the explorer Louis Jolliet. Jolliet, finding himself in possession of the largest privately-owned island in the world, built a fort for his family there. Despite its size, Anticosti has never been a well-populated island, likely due to its treacherous coastline.<br> <br>(Fun fact: Over 400 ships wrecked themselves on the rocks and reefs surrounding the island, earning it the nickname “The Cemetery of the Gulf”. –V.)<br><br>Anticosti became a territory of the British Empire as part of the Treaty of Paris that ended the Seven Years War, and officially became part of the province of Quebec in 1867.<br>

John, sit down!"<br><br>[Chorus]<br>Come along, come along, You jolly brave boys,<br>There's lots of grog in the jar.<br>We'll plough the briny ocean line<br>With the jolly roving tar.<br><br>When Jack ashore, he’ll make his way<br>To some old boarding house.<br>He’s  welcomed in with rum and gin,<br>Likewise with pork scouse.<br><br>He'll spend and spend and never offend<br>Till he's lies drunk on the ground<br>When the money's gone<br>It's the same old song,<br>"Get up Jack! John, sit down!"<br><br>[Chorus]<br><br>Then Jack then will slip aboard some ship <br>bound for India or Japan, <br>Then in Asia there, the ladies fair, <br>they all love a sailor man, <br>He’ll go ashore, and he’ll not scorn to buy some girl a gown: <br>When his money's gone<br>It's the same old song,<br>"Get up Jack! John, sit down!"<br><br>[Chorus]<br><br>When Jack is old and weather-beat, too old to cruise about, <br>They'll let him stop in some rum shop till eight bells calls him out, <br>Then he'll raise his hands high, and loud he'll cry: Thank Christ! I'm homeward bound:<br>But his money's gone<br>It's the same old song,<br>"Get up Jack! John, sit down!"<br><br>[Chorus]<br>

In 1746, he met Achilles and Liam O’Brien, who were working with the French Army on behalf of the Assassins.

Born: 1726<br>Died: unknown<br><br>Liam O'Brien was born in Plymouth, Massachusetts, to Irish immigrants. After years of struggling to survive on a farm, the family moved to New York where his father began to work for a rich merchant, loading ships bound for England. Liam eventually joined him, and it was there he first met a young boy named Shay Cormac, who was visiting his father in the merchant marine. The two boys became friends and Liam looked after the younger boy, who lived in a rough neighborhood, and was showing a talent for getting into trouble.<br><br>As Liam continued to work, he was shocked to learn that despite all the profits made by their employer, the employees remained underpaid and mistreated. Tensions rose between the two sides. In 1736, Liam recruited a few of his young co-workers to begin robbing their employer. However, he was caught and was forced to kill a man in self-defense. In order to protect his son, his father took the blame for the murder and was executed by the authorities.<br><br>Lost, Liam drifted from one job to the next, distancing himself from everyone he knew, including his young friend Shay. He kept on robbing New York’s richer citizens so he could send money to his mother, whom he was too ashamed to face.<br><br>In 1738, he met Achilles, who began to give him small tasks to perform, such as delivering messages to a Wolastoqiyik man named Kesegowaase in the frontier. Achilles’ influence grew on him. He began to look up to the man who finally managed to teach him about right and wrong, and eventually, the Assassins and their Creed.<br><br>In 1743, Liam became Achilles’ first mentee, and quickly learned from him. Liam helped Achilles recruit the remainder of his colonial Brotherhood: Chevalier de la Vérendrye, Kesegowaase, and Hope. <br><br>In 1748, Liam found his childhood friend Shay Cormac, whose life was shattered after his father died at sea. Liam helped him get back on his feet and the two became inseparable. Later that year, Liam introduced Shay to Achilles, and it wasn’t long before his young friend joined the Assassins. Liam was tasked to keep an eye on the latest recruit.<br>

When his training was complete, Achilles was sent North to establish a Brotherhood in the American Colonies.  <br><br>Achilles married a woman named Abigail and they had a son, Connor. Achilles established a homestead where his Brotherhood could settle before expanding throughout the frontier. He recruited several promising colonials, including Liam O’Brien, Chevalier Louis-Joseph Gauthier de la Vérendrye, Kesegowaase, Hope Jensen, and finally, Shay Cormac to the Brotherhood. Achilles strengthened the ties between the Brotherhood and the nations of the Iroquois confederacy, particularly the Kanien'kehá:ka.<br>

While visiting his father at the docks one day, Shay met an older boy, Liam O’Brien, and the two became friends. Shay was raised by his aunt in a poor and dangerous neighborhood, and Liam helped Shay learn how to fend for himself. <br><br>By the tender age of eight, Shay earned a reputation as a brawler, and his father brought him aboard his ship. Shay was always on the lookout for an adventure, and although he would miss his friend Liam, he eagerly agreed and began to work for a living. Shay began to train with a sword and pistol so he could join the crew in fending off pirates. In one such incident, Shay singlehandedly faced down and shot a pirate captain, saving his ship.<br><br>In 1747, disaster struck at sea when a storm claimed many lives of Shay’s crew, including his father. Shay returned to New York and spent his days wandering from one tavern to the next, starting one brawl after another.<br><br>By chance, in 1748, Shay reunited with Liam O’Brien, who helped him get back on his feet. After that, the two became inseparable. Liam introduced Shay to Achilles and learned about the Assassins and their Creed. He joined them a year later, and his training was assigned to Liam and his fellow recruits Hope Jensen, Chevalier de la Vérendrye, and Kesegowaase.<br><br>(Bromance alert. –V.)

Born: 1725<br>Died: 1781<br><br>Haytham was born in London. His father was Edward Kenway, a former pirate who trained him with a secret purpose. One day before his tenth birthday, young Haytham’s home was burned, his half-sister Jenny was taken, and his father was killed. Reginald Birch, a family friend, offered to help and revealed he was a Templar, though the boy hardly understood what this implied at the time. Haytham was introduced to Edward “The Bulldog” Braddock, a soldier in the Royal Army and fellow Templar, and the two took an instant dislike to each other.<br><br>Years passed in a fruitless search for his half-sister, and Haytham and Birch settled in Troyes, France. Haytham became a ruthless and efficient killer for the Templars. While searching for his father’s killer, he met Braddock in Germany and served in his Coldstreams unit in the War of Austrian Succession. <br><br>In 1754, Haytham killed an Assassin named Miko in London to acquire an amulet needed to find a First Civilization storehouse. Birch sent him to the colonies to establish an official Templar presence while he searched for the Precursor site. He secured the assistance of Kanien'kehá:ka natives by freeing several captives, including  a woman named Ziio, with whom he had an ill-fated but passionate affair.<br><br>In 1755, Haytham got word from his European contacts that Jenny was found in the Ottoman Empire. He left the colonies to rescue her, and was shocked when she revealed that Birch and the Templars were behind the attack on his home. Their father was an Assassin, and Birch had him killed for his secrets. Together, they traveled to Troyes and killed Birch. Haytham returned to the colonies in 1758.<br><br>(Fun fact: Haytham kept a diary! I wonder why he never mentioned Shay in it. –V.)

Born: 1692 <br>Died: Unknown<br><br>Born to enslaved parents in Trinidad, Adéwalé was sold to the owner of a prosperous plantation before his teens. He escaped by joining a group of buccaneers who raided the plantation. <br><br>Adé sailed with this group of men for many years, honing his skills as a sailor. In 1715, he was captured by Spanish authorities, who decided to send Adéwalé to Spain, and loaded him into one of the galleons that made up their perennial treasure fleet. Thanks to a hurricane, as well as a young Welsh pirate named Edward Kenway, Adé escaped. Freeing more prisoners along the way, Adé and Edward commandeered a brigantine and set sail just in time to beat the worst of the storm. When the hurricane passed, Adé was free once more.<br><br>Adé became the quartermaster aboard Captain Kenway’s ship, the Jackdaw. Operating out of Nassau for a time, they grew wealthy off their spoils and lived the lives they had always dreamed of. But Adé was a man who valued the democratic ideals of this pirate community far above the spoils they acquired while living it. And as he saw Edward Kenway fall deeper into a spiral of selfish greed and pointless glory, he wondered if there wasn't a more noble cause he might adopt to suit his ideals.<br><br>In 1716, Adé first encountered the Assassins in Tulum. He returned in 1719, where he spoke with their Mentor Ah Tabai and asked him many questions about their Brotherhood. After hearing answers that pleased him greatly, Adé joined them. For the next fifteen years, Adéwalé faithfully served the Assassins. But in time, he became increasingly troubled by memories of his past.<br><br>In 1735, Adé’s ship was caught in a storm, and he washed ashore near Port-au-Prince. There, he met Bastienne Josephe and Augustin Dieufort, whose passion drew him to the Maroon cause. In the following years, he used his skills to help rebuild the Maroon resistance in Port-au-Prince. He fled Saint Domingue in 1737 after killing the governor, Pierre, Marquis de Fayet, and returned to the Assassins.

He was rewarded with the title of “chevalier” (knight) from his father, who passed over Louis-Joseph’s older brother to do so. He spent the next four years exploring North Dakota and Manitoba.<br><br>In 1744, de la Vérendrye became a frontier post commander for the French government. It was around this time that he met Achilles and Liam O’Brien and helped them complete an Assassin mission. In 1746, Achilles asked de la Vérendrye to join him, an offer that was gladly accepted.<br><br>De la Vérendrye lost his father in 1749, and further explorations westward were disrupted by politics. Later that same year, he met Shay Cormac for the first time and took an instant dislike to him.<br><br>In 1752, De la Vérendrye returned to fur trading, but business did not go well for him.<br>

In 1754, militiamen under his command ambushed a French patrol who were encroaching a nearby fort, and it became the first battle of the French and Indian War. Later that same year, Washington surrendered to the French at the Battle of Fort Necessity but mistakenly signed a document saying their commander was “assassinated.” <br><br>(Fun fact: Washington’s allies fired first and without provocation.

Born: 1706 <br>Died: 1790<br><br>Benjamin Franklin was born in Boston, the tenth son of a soap-maker. While apprenticing for his brother, a printer, he gained fame as a writer, working under the pseudonym “Mrs. Silence Dogood”. In 1723, Franklin moved to Philadelphia and continued his career in printing and writing as well as other odd jobs. In 1725, he visited the Royal Society of London for scientific experiments. <br><br>Upon his return to the colonies, Franklin became a true polymath. He created “the Junto”, a discussion group for issues of the day that inspired many other intellectual societies. In 1732 he created one of the first subscription libraries in the colonies, and the following year began to publish his famous “Poor Richard’s Almanack.” Over a decade later, he began his experiments with electricity, using it to create and improve devices such as the capacitor and the Leyden jar.<br><br>His political writing began to gain attention and in 1754, Franklin attended the Albany Congress to discuss the conflict with the French colonies as well as tensions with the Iroquois Nation. He proposed a unified government to organize the colonies, and created the political cartoon with the motto “Join or Die.” Although the unification was accepted by the delegates at the conference, it was rejected by the British Board of Trade.<br><br>Franklin took several political trips to England to represent colonial interests. Although he initially fought for the rights of colonists as British citizens, he concluded that independence was the true solution. Franklin contributed writing to the Declaration of Independence and was present at its signing on July 4, 1776.<br><br>For the remainder of the American Revolution, Franklin lived in Paris as the American ambassador to France.<br>

In 1745, he moved to the fishing village of Staithes where he first heard the siren song of the sea. He apprenticed in the merchant navy, while studying algebra, geometry, navigation, and astronomy, which would serve him well in the future.<br><br>(Nobody READS anymore, you know? –V.)<br><br>After rising through the ranks of the merchant navy, Cook volunteered for service in the Royal Navy to see action in the Seven Years’ War. <br><br>During the Seven Years’ War Cook served as the master of the HMS Pembroke. He took part in the capture of the Fortress of Louisbourg, the Siege of Quebec City, and the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. <br><br>(Fun fact: Americans refer to the war as the French and Indian War. French Canadians call it the War of the Conquest, and – my favorite – The Swedish call it the Pomeranian War.

Born: 1718<br>Died: 1752<br><br>Lawrence Washington was born in Virginia and was a mentor of sorts to his more famous half-brother George Washington. Lawrence was educated in England, where he was recruited into the Templar Order by Grand Master Reginald Birch. Lawrence returned to Virginia in 1738 to oversee his father’s plantation on the Potomac River, and also to seek out Precursor relics. <br><br>In 1739, the British Parliament created an infantry for its American colonies, to be used in their conflict against Spain in the West Indies. Lawrence Washington arrived in Jamaica in 1741 and saw action in expeditions against Cartagena, New Granada, Cuba, and Panama. Many casualties in these conflicts were the result of disease rather than violence. Because he arrived in the tropics early, he managed to survive fevers that decimated the other American colonists. Upon his return to the American colonies, Washington became a militia commander at the rank of Major. <br><br>Washington married Anne Fairfax in 1743. In 1747, he, his father-in-law, and other prominent businessmen began to work together, with the goal of opening trade to the American interior.  <br><br>Lawrence was diagnosed with tuberculosis and traveled to Barbados with his younger brother George in an attempt to help his health. George caught a minor case of smallpox and Lawrence used the opportunity to travel to Port-au-Prince on Templar business. Lawrence returned to his Mount Vernon home in July 1752, where he died from his disease. His younger brother George eventually inherited and took over management of the Mount Vernon plantation. <br>

Albany

The Albany region was originally inhabited by the Algonquian tribes, in particular the Mohicans and Iroquois. Albany was claimed by the Dutch explorer Henry Hudson in 1609 and was settled in 1614, and trading posts were created soon after. <br><br>The British took control of the area in 1664 and renamed the town of Beverwijck as Albany. As tensions rose between England and France, troops were gathered at Albany to attack the enemy colonies to the North. Colonel William Johnson rallied his allies in the Iroquois Confederacy in Albany and convinced them to declare war against the French. <br><br>The British Lords of Trade suggested that the colonies meet in Albany to discuss their common defence. It was at this meeting that Benjamin Franklin first proposed a union between the colonies. <br><br>(I’m more a fan of the British Lords of Time, if you know what I mean. –V.)<br>

Halifax

Halifax was established in 1749, violating a treaty and triggering Father Le Loutre’s War. This conflict pitted the British and New England colonists against the French and the Mi’kmaq nation, and would lead to several devastating attacks, including the Dartmouth Massacre of 1751. Eventually, it led to British dominance in the region and the expulsion of the Acadians. <br><br>During the Seven Years War, Halifax became a naval base, which would prove crucial in the Siege of Louisburg (1758). It became the headquarters for the Royal Navy in North America and would also play an important strategic role during the American Revolution.<br><br>The conflict with the Mi’kmaq finally ended in 1761, with a series of peace treaties that culminated in the “Burying of the Hatchet Ceremony”.<br><br>(And people think that Canadians are dull. We are not! –V.)<br>

The Davenport Homestead was a collection of buildings that served as the headquarters for the Colonial Assassin Brotherhood. Achilles built a manor for his family and a barracks for Assassins to rest in in between their missions throughout the colonies.

During the Age of Discovery, Libson launched many expeditions, among them, Vasco da Gama’s journey to India in 1497. By the 16th Century, Lisbon was a hub for commerce with Africa, India, and Brazil, doing trade in spices, slaves, sugar, and textiles. By the early 18th century, gold from Brazil allowed King John V to transform the city into one of the largest cities in Europe.<br><br>(Fun fact: Some of da Gama’s expeditions to India were actually Templar plots to draw out Assassins in Calicut. –V.)<br><br>Lisbon also had a history of earthquakes. There were at least sixteen recorded in the three centuries before the one in 1755. But the 1755 earthquake was so damaging that it inspired the French philosopher Voltaire to write a long poem about the tragedy.<br><br>(When has poetry ever improved anything? Answer: Never.

John Washington, great-grandfather to Lawrence and George, bought the land in 1674 with his friend Nicholas Spencer. The acreage was then referred to by its native name of Epsewasson. In 1690, the heirs of Washington and Spencer split the land, leaving the Washingtons with the portion that ran along Little Hunting Creek. <br><br>Lawrence Washington’s father Augustine renamed it Little Hunting Creek. In 1738, Lawrence returned from school in England and began to oversee the family’s tobacco plantation. When he inherited the estate, he renamed it Mount Vernon, in honor of Vice Admiral Edward Vernon, who was his commanding officer in the Royal Navy. When his half-brother George Washington inherited the property, he kept the name.<br>

The Dutch West India Company created a settlement in what is now Albany in 1617 and founded New Amsterdam on Manhattan Island. New Amsterdam surrendered to Colonel Richard Nicholls in 1664, who renamed it the Province of New York. Over the next several years, the area transitioned to British Rule, and remained there, despite a few conflicts such as the Third Anglo-Dutch War and the Glorious Revolution. <br><br>At the turn of the 17th Century, New York was the largest importer of slaves to the colonies and a supply port for pirates. Almost 3000 Palatine German emigrants were sent to New York by Queen Anne’s government in 1710, and Sephardic Jews expelled from Dutch Brazil found a home there. These factors helped make New York a diverse and cosmopolitan city.<br>

The cold winters as well as the resistance of indigenous people resulted in the failure of many early European settlements.<br><br>By the 18th century, however, colonies were well-established and trading routes across the ocean were common. Even so, the most northerly regions were still relatively unexplored, with ice blocking the way of even the most adventurous explorers.<br>

Although explorers such as John Cabot noted the gulf of the St. Lawrence River in the 15th century, the first European explorer to sail up the river itself was Jacques Cartier, with help from some local Iroquois. He misunderstood the Huron-Iroquois word for village, Kanata, and began to refer to the larger area north of the river as “Canada”.<br><br>Explorers and fur trader opened up the territory. French settlements limited the westward expansion of the British, and before long they grew alarmed at the potential scope of French expansionism. The British and French clashed frequently in the colonies, and eventually the Seven Years’ War broke out in 1755.<br>

The exact date of Europeans settling the land is unknown, but the Dutch fought against local natives in the early days of New Netherlands. In 1655, a Dutch colonist published a document that referred to the area as “Slapershaven” or, literally, “Sleepers’ Haven”. In 1664, the British took over the colony and renamed it New York. The village would be officially incorporated as North Tarrytown in the 19th century. The Anglicized version of this name did not appear until later and was not used as the town’s proper name until centuries later.<br><br>The village is best known as the setting of “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” by Washington Irving. <br><br>(Irving’s story was successful enough to get North Tarrytown to change its name to Sleepy Hollow in 1996, but not enough to make anyone named Ichabod attractive or popular. –V.)<br>

Originally a hunting lodge built for Louis XIII, the Palace of Versailles was expanded into one of the largest palaces in the world, and the seat of the French monarchy, under the reign of his successor, Louis XIV. The royal family abandoned the palace for the Tuileries in Paris at the outset of the French Revolution. After the King's arrest, Versailles, along with all royal possessions, was confiscated and sealed. The furnishings were sold at auction in 1793, and in 1794 it was turned into a museum. Despite the various restorations, empires, and revolutions that followed, Versailles would never again be a center of political power.<br><br>(I went here on a school trip once. Yawnsville.

Also known as the Northwest Passage, this sea route was sought for centuries by explorers hoping to connect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, although any real progress was often impeded by ice.<br><br>The desire to establish a trade route to the Indies and China resulted in various attempts to find a path. The first recorded effort was sponsored by Henry VII of England in 1497 and carried out by Italian explorer Giovanni Caboto (or as he is better known, John Cabot). <br><br>In 1776, Captain James Cook was coaxed out of retirement to lead another such expedition. However, despite his expertise and extensive research, he encountered nothing but icebergs.<br><br>In 1845, Sir John Franklin led another attempt, this one ending in a far worse fate. The expedition became trapped in the ice and was lost, with no known survivors. Then the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen made an attempt, inspired in part by Franklin’s lost expedition. His voyage, which lasted from 1903 to 1906, marked the first time that the passage was successfully traversed by ship.

I fear there may be no Rite established here until her Brotherhood is eradicated. I fear the West Indies may be lost to us.<br><br>I will stay in Havana for a time.

1751<br>Dear Achilles,<br><br>Do you remember your Auntie Rhona? You were but a wee bairn when I last saw you. We would not even let you carry a real blade, but from all accounts you are making us proud up there in the North. <br><br>The reason I am writing to you after all this time is that I have gone and made a bit of a mess. You would think, being a Master Assassin in charge of Havana that I would have neither the time nor the energy to carry on these dalliances with the stunning array of beautiful menfolk that wander through Havana. And yet, I feel that I must take every opportunity to enjoy myself, because Lord knows I am not getting any younger. At the very least, you might think I would know better than to get caught in bed with a Templar. Again.<br><br>I’m not making you uncomfortable with all this randy blather, am I? You always were such a serious child. Anyway, the scoundrel’s name is Rafael Joaquín de Ferrer. He has fled Havana with some of the items bequeathed to me by Ah Tabai, ancient maps of the Yucatán Peninsula and some of my correspondence with other Assassins in the West Indies.<br><br>Things here are tenser than the knots in de Ferrer’s muscular back. The Spanish, French, and British are all itching to control my lovely city. My lovely Assassins desperately want to chase after de Ferrer and murder him, but I need everyone to stay in Havana to keep the people safe from another boring conflict between Empires. I am as busy as I have ever been, but, it all feels so terribly bland. What happened to the grand adventures that saw us racing against the Templars for a powerful artefact that time forgot? Now it is just a territorial squabble between faraway regents. Maybe that is another reason why I let myself get fooled by that sinewy devil. He made me feel young again. <br><br>Being of a Spanish persuasion, if de Ferrer is not in Mexico, he will likely be in a colony close by, either Florida or perhaps even France’s Louisiana. If you find him, be a good boy and give him a stab in the neck from your old auntie.<br><br>Rhona Dinsmore<br>Havana

1751<br>My dear Chevalier,<br><br>I am sorry to hear about your troubles with the captain of the Aquila. A ship like that deserves the best, and as such, I will not take her helm. I am unworthy of such a vessel. I would only bring her to ruin, and I would never forgive myself if anything were to happen to her.<br><br>I do feel able, however, to serve as first mate. I will look after that ship as if she were my own flesh and blood. I will make damn sure the crew treats her the same. <br><br>However, before I set foot aboard, I have identified some obstacles closer to home. I believe that two powerful French shipping companies are Templar-owned: the Levesque family of France and the De l’Isle family down in Louisiana. They are sending twice as many ships out to sea, but their profits do not seem to be increasing. What are those devils hiding?<br><br>We still have some work to do securing our operations here before I can justify leaving my life here behind and joining your cause completely. <br><br>Until then, I will do as much as I can to lend aid, for I have a feeling that dark days are ahead for you lot.

If, nay, when he does, he is sure to send his most dangerous agent, Master Haytham Kenway. <br><br>There may be Templars in the New World now. No doubt you have clashed with them already. But you have not encountered cunning or danger until you have faced a British Templar. I dread the day that I might face Kenway myself, and I implore you to heed my call for caution.<br><br>My next mission takes me to Corsica so I must prepare for my journey.

Date: 1751<br>Grand Master,<br><br>Florida under Alonso Fernández de Heredia looks to be running smoothly. Already he has established a naval stores industry, and the Spanish government is poised to populate the area. I would expect no less from the first Templar governor the area has seen since Laureano Torres, God rest his soul.<br><br>As instructed, he continues to send raids against British forces here in Georgia, to divert attention away from our operation. As slaves are sent to Florida, he transfers them to de Ferrer in Mexico. I recommend that we make Fernández the governor of Yucatán as soon as possible as de Ferrer’s work site will soon need protection from prying eyes.<br><br>I further recommend that the Order leave Florida. Although the Assassins have not set foot in Florida for centuries, there is a new Brotherhood at work in the northern colonies, and Florida is too accessible. I recommend Louisiana as a new base of operations for the Chichén Itzá excavation. The de l’Isle woman has proven herself ruthless and capable. I believe a promotion to Master Templar with the mandate to oversee the Chichén Itzá operation would be a logical next step for her.<br><br>May the Father of Understanding guide you.<br>John Harrison<br>Savannah, Georgia

He is a bright boy and I hope to spare his tender heart from the ugly truths of our most serious business.<br><br>Once in Haiti, I wasted no time in tracking down the Assassins. They are led by a one-armed Maroon leader named François Mackandal.  A reckless tyrant if ever I have seen one. I tracked his man Vendredi to the entrance of a cave of some kind. My plan was to ambush him on his way out. But as I lay in wait, an earthquake struck. The Assassin came running out of the crevasse, but his legs were crushed under falling debris. I promised to free him if he told me where Mackandal was hiding. He did, and I slit his throat. I should have liked to explore the cave myself, but the entrance was obliterated. <br><br>The devastation provided an excellent cover for my approach on Mackandal’s camp. I stole two Pieces of Eden in his possession: a strange Precursor box and a mysterious manuscript. <br><br>By the time you receive this, I will already be on my way back to Virginia.

1751<br>Hello, father.<br><br>The situation in Port-au-Prince remains grim. There is still no sign of Vendredi, and I begin to suspect, as you do, that Mackandal sent him away with a sinister purpose. I suspect that he is dead, but I do not think it was the earthquake that killed him.<br><br>Our contacts in the colonies to the north have revealed that Lawrence Washington has returned with the stolen artefacts in his possession. Your old friend Achilles is there. I suggest you seek him out.<br><br>I remain here, to do what I can, but Mackandal grows ever more unstable. I fear that by starting over, our deranged Mentor will be driven to committing a truly awful act. As promised, I will keep a watchful eye on him as best I can.<br><br>It is my hope that when your business in the colonies has concluded that you will return here. Help me reform our Brotherhood and make Saint-Domingue a home.<br><br>Please guide me to victory.<br>Babatunde Josephe<br>Port-au-Prince

A Rude Awakening

Id: [0x02626A95]
Abruptly pulled out of an Animus session by Violet, a security contractor. Apparently accessing the Shay Cormac file triggered a virus that’s affected the whole building. I’m still a bit disoriented. I should stick with Violet until I can find Ms. Lemay and learn more about what’s happening.

Melanie has asked me to work with Violet and Mr. Berg, security contractors from Abstergo Industries. Violet seems to know her stuff and isn’t afraid to crack the whip. We restore servers, fix PCs, clean up tablets, and deal with weird camera glitches. All this from one virus?

Id: [0x02626A99]
Mr. Berg is really focused on Shay Cormac. Something tells me that the virus was meant to destroy or hide his story. I wonder how it ties into what’s going on here. I’ve been asked to fix servers on the CCO’s floor. Maybe Melanie can shed some light.

Id: [0x02626A9B]
 I finished researching Shay’s story. I think that the conflict between the Assassins and Templars didn’t end in the past. In fact, I think it’s still happening and I’m in the middle of it. Violet and Mr. Berg seem happy with me. But should I be happy about that?

Shay Patrick Cormac, a young man of ill manners but moral intentions, finds himself a member of those infamous renegades, the Assassin Brotherhood. 

Id: [0x026270B6]
Months pass and what began as mere enmity between the British and French ignites into war. Meanwhile, the Assassin Shay hones his technique while cutting a swathe through the ubiquitous Templar Order. 

Id: [0x026270B7]
In New York, Shay awakens in the home of a kindly and venerable couple, the Finnegans. He soon finds that their existence is far from peaceful, however, as they and their neighbors are terrorized by roving gangs of ill-doers. 

Id: [0x026270B8]
The war rages on and Shay's Templar friend Colonel Monro finds himself outmanned and outmatched at Fort William Henry.

Id: [0x026270B9]
Having attracted the attention of the Templar Grand Master, Haytham Kenway, Shay plunges himself into martial matters. 

Id: [0x026270BA]
Back in New York, the battle-hardened Shay searches for the source of both the criminal activity and its toxic weaponry.

Id: [0x026270BB]
Shay and Haytham sail on in search of the artifacts. The Assassins are a step ahead of them, but not for long.

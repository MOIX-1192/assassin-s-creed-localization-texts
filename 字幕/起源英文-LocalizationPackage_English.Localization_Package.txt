H - you know I share your concerns about Sefetu, but I believe a greater force directs him. This is the Scarab. Perhaps a mix of myth and rumor, but I think he exists. I think he controls some of the Pharaoh's soldiers, through fear or greed. That is why I was tortured, when I discovered a rich payment to one of the captains. They nearly killed me - I would have died after they mutilated me - if they had not thrown me onto the road where Taharqa found me and brought me home.

Once a new bull was chosen, it was installed in the Great Temple, accompanied by a lavish ceremony lasting seven days.

The arsonist can enter her villa via the dock, our archer can provide one fatal arrow through her heart posted at a high point, Livius should try a more direct approach and I'm sure Alexus can find a proper way to infiltrate with his eccentric methods, he always does. I trust you will ensure the job is done. I await your arrival excitedly, our navy could use a good warrior to bolster any new war efforts on the horizon. <LF>The Order of Ancients is strong, soon enough peace and order will be our gift to the people of Egypt.

My revered friend. Why would one seek to serve the public if they cared nothing for their welfare? I cannot believe you are not a good man. But the people tell me that they come to you begging for your help and you turn them away. I have also heard that some of the farms near your villa have been taxed excessively for the ‘war effort'. For what war is this that you bleed the region dry? We have peace in Kyrenaika. We have a duty to our people, Leander, do not forget that.

Building is divided into two parts. The first regulates the general plan of a city and its public buildings; the other relates to private buildings. Public buildings are for defense, religion, and the security of the public. Buildings for defense shelter the city's inhabitants against the attacks of an enemy.

The chosen one is dressed in the robes of lesser divinity. They are sealed up and the goddess both steals their air. Once they have passed over, we remove their most sacred viscera for meditation, and as a gift to the Lady of Stings. Once we have the goddess's trust, she will make us all god-kings and travel to the stars.

Nothing less would have persuaded that stubborn woman to fear me, and I had to have her absolute compliance.<LF>But when the time came, I couldn't do it. My own daughter would be Ipy's age had she lived. It's true what they say, that a child's death never leaves you. Ipy became my consolation. <LF>The only thing I fear is that she discovers the truth. She would surely hate me. She must never know.

<img src='QuestObjective'/> Letter

Id: [0x000EAFE9]
Abar refuses to hand over the last key. She busies herself with simple tasks in that pathetic fishing village east of Herakleion, telling the children tales of her past glories. Of course, I could easily steal the key, but she deserves the respect due a war leader. I will try again to speak to her, as I know we all want to see this "great treasure" of hers. More news as it comes.

Id: [0x000EB001]
Phylakes' Prey

The hunter has become the hunted. The legendary Phylakes, elite warriors of Ptolemy, are on Bayek's trail.

Id: [0x000EB003]
Bayek is attacked by a powerful warrior. Searching his body reveals him as a member of the Phylakes, elite warriors of the Pharaoh Ptolemy, whose latest orders are to carry out Bayek's death. Bayek is left with no choice but to kill them before they can carry out their orders. And though life is its own reward, there may be more to be gained from this adventure than Bayek initially realizes.

In the center of Sap-Meh Nome you can find me hidden in a canyon near Anthylla. I'm under a tree that thinks it's unique, but only because the nearby rock bridge is blocking it from seeing the others of its breed.

Id: [0x000EFA33]
In the east section of the Kanopos Nome is a ravaged land, where many trees fell and lost their home. I'm by the orphan tree whose parents fell down nearby, pointing towards their lonely daughter.

Id: [0x000EFA38]
Alexandria is large and noisy, but one part is quiet, lonely, and surrounded by water. The fallen palm tree points to where I lay, where land meets water.

Id: [0x000EFA3D]
In the south section of Mareotis Lake there is an island full of ruins. A man stares at me all day, it's quite a bother, so I'm hiding behind a column that blocks his sight.

Id: [0x000EFA42]
In Herakleion Nome, East of the temple of Khonsou, is a village that is more water than land. Behind two houses with different problems, one whose feet are always wet, and the other who can't cover his head, you can find me sitting under a tree.

Id: [0x000EFA47]
A few hundred meters north west of the Temple of Sekhmet in Yamu, which resides by Lake Mareotis, there is a great place to go for a date. Full of palm trees and surrounded by desert, one rock fence was built and closed off with no exit. Find me there.

Id: [0x000EFA4C]
In South East of Iment Nome lies a broken ship. Pass time till morning, an X will mark my hiding spot.

Id: [0x000EFA51]
In Faiyum, north of Dionysias Caravanserai there is a tower with a hole by its feet. It's in need of support, so I sit behind it, but the wooden beams seem more helpful.

Id: [0x000EFA56]
Two men stand guard on the Memphis eastern canal. The south one looks solemnly at his sunken friend. If you follow his gaze, you can find him and me on the river floor.

Id: [0x000EFA5B]
On an Island south east of Krokodilopolis there is a river with unnatural color. Nearby you'll see the cause, and I'll be inside the only one that's unique.

Id: [0x000EFA60]
If you head to the other side of the Nile in Ineb-Hedjet Nome, you can find a peak with a great view of the Nile. Take a look around, then come find me, hiding under the only tree nearby.

Id: [0x000EFA65]
Southeast of the city Hermopolis is a leopard's den in Uab Nome. At the top of their territory lies a place where birds should live, but do not. If you take a leap of faith, you can find me.

Id: [0x000EFA6A]
East of Krokodilopolis, south of the shattered pyramid, a large beast of a god stares angrily at a pharaoh who shows him no respect. I'm hidden behind the blasphemer's head.

Id: [0x000EFA6F]
There is a place of remembrance for the unfortunate masses in north west Haueris Nome. While I rest here, immobile, I cannot escape Ra's grace, but at least every dawn I avoid him longer than the others.

In Siwa, come find me at the bottom of the only bowl big enough for a god.

Id: [0x000EFA79]
In the Green Mountains where they're building a great aqueduct, go find its source high up in the mountains. Inside, you can find me sitting at the bottom of the lowest pool, tucked away beside two large jars.

Id: [0x000EFA7E]
At the bottom border of Paraitonion is a village of ghosts. I'm in the house of the blasphemous man, who built his house furthest from Ra, the sun god's, dawning grace.

Id: [0x000EFA83]
North of Apollonia, I'm next to a life saver. It guides in darkness and fog, and I sit beside it under something that did not heed its warning.

Id: [0x000EFA88]
In the southwest section of the Green Mountains lives a monstrous beast with sharp tusks and tough grey skin. In his deadly arena you can find me, between the edge of the arena and where the beast sates his thirst.

Id: [0x000EFA8D]
South of Cyrene, in the Green Mountains, there is a lake whose water comes from a magical stream. I'll be at the source of that magic, where water flows from nothing.

The journey was perilous, but we have arrived. The summit has become savage. At night, we heard wild dogs howling and one day a lion stalked us until Idas chased it away with a stick. But now we can really begin to honor our teacher. We need nothing but good company and lively discussion and if that runs out, we have a bladder of wine. Nothing can dull my excitement for we are the birth of something that will outlive us all. Your loving son, Phe'sho.

Id: [0x000F3C9B]

My dearest. It has been a strange month here. Bebi came last week and said we must work faster, that the King is growing weaker by the day. I told him give me another ten thousand men and we would build it in a day. We drank that night and laughed. But it turned to sadness when Bebi returned again from Thebes. He told me then that the king could not wait for his great edifice to be completed... what a waste of treasure. But least I will see you sooner than we hoped.

# Animus Control Panel<LF> <LF> <LF>Animus Control Panel is a tool that allows you to hack and modify the Animus simulation parameters.<LF> <LF>By using this tool to hack the Animus, you will be able to do things like changing controllable character, their physical capabilities and even change the historical relations between world factions. Just try to tweak some settings like Movement Speed, press Apply and you’ll see the result in-game.
<LF><LF>To activate the Animus you need to:<LF> <LF>##### 1. Hack an existing save slot in-game (it will create a hacked duplicate of your save slot).<LF>##### 2. Load the save slot with the hacked Animus.<LF>##### 3. Access the Animus Control Panel in the Uplay overlay.<LF>##### 4. Change settings to fit your vision.<LF>##### 5. Press Apply to activate the changes, or Save them for later.<LF> <LF> <LF>Note, that a modified simulation can highly effect the world balance and you may experience unpredictable side effects and challenges out of historical context… Though it is said, that one who masters the Animus Control Panel, can become free to do anything within the Animus simulation.
<LF><LF>If your efforts fail… you can always revert to the initial and un-hacked save slot in the simulation…

Our summer feast in her honor no longer sways her. She creeps ever closer, and the breath of the War Lion brings the heat and sand of the desert into the heart of the city.<LF>The oracles say she wishes to claim all Egypt for herself, and swallow it whole, unless we make a grand sacrifice. Her wab priests have told the nomarch to give up the city, and that will appease her.

My love, I think your father out did himself this time. I told you the man had it out for me. This guard post he had me stationed at is impossibly dangerous. <LF>It's probably not wise to light a fire in these bandit infested lands but it's either that or I'm getting eaten alive by hyenas.<LF>My dear Behenu, please try to make him come to his senses and let me come home.

Id: [0x00104359]
I have failed to appease the goddess. Perhaps I should not have used an unworthy vessel. Yet he was but a humble traveler, coming from nowhere, going nowhere, I did him an honor. I showed him the light of the goddess. I told him she would take his breath for a moment, and then return it with a kiss. And in that moment he would become my teacher, and I would learn all that he saw and heard touched and smelled and tasted. But it was for nothing. I tried my hand at removing his viscera. It was not as simple as the priests have said. I may have ruined it all.<LF>I realize now that the chosen should be divine, but faces of lesser divnity. Priests of other gods will open the door for me. And I will learn, and teach my followers how to handle the sacred viscera with more care and love. We will create our gifts in solemn places, and the goddess will be pleased, and open the doors to the stars for us.

ACTAEON

Aya's first kill. While tracing the Order in Alexandria, Aya came across Actaeon and verified her suspicions when she discovered one of the masks in his apartments.

Most of the men Bayek is after are as yet nameless, but he has discovered the name of Medunamun. Installed as Oracle of Siwa by Ptolemy, Medunamun oversees the Temple of Amun.

THE CROCODILE

Id: [0x00104D2A]
BERENIKE

Id: [0x00104D2B]
A uniquely subtle operative of the Order of Ancients who uses manipulation, diplomacy, and legislative corruption to enact a totalitarian vision of peace and order across the Faiyum. The Crocodile ruthlessly enforces the Order's plan of control, all while hidden behind a cloak of anonymity.

KHALISET

Id: [0x00104D2E]
In the Giza plateau, a member of the Order called the Hyena prowls the barren landscape. Stories of disappearances and deaths plague the community. With relics, tombs and other mysteries hidden beneath the sands, the merchants, scavengers and bandits who occupy the area are always at odds, yet they all share a common sentiment when it comes to the Hyena: Fear.

FLAVIUS

Id: [0x00104D3A]
Defined by his ruthless ambition, the proconsul of the province of Kyrenaika is a brutally efficient soldier with a distinguished military career. Which is why Julius Caesar's considers him one of most powerful allies. However, Flavius has his own agenda and is prepared to go to any lengths to cement his influence in Rome.

Id: [0x00104D3B]
GAIUS JULIUS CAESAR

Id: [0x00104D3C]
A charismatic and bold man, Caesar has risen up the ranks of the Republic and crossed the Rubicon to be the foremost politician in Rome. Beloved by both his inner circle and the people of the eternal city, Gaius Julius is a born leader and strong orator, as adept at politics as he is at military strategy. However, when he arrives in Alexandria, he is quickly seduced by Egypt and her young queen.

On Vesta's Son Oidipous

Id: [0x00105317]
Akakios would not believe me when I told him who I was. His whore's child. His child. He laughed, called me androgynous, son of the goddess of love and her messenger. He would not embrace me, so Thanatos held him until he struggled no more. And still she screams in whispers. I hear her every waking hour, every sleeping moment. I can not live with this shame. I will not. Vesta

Id: [0x00105318]
I am the child of a meretrix, shunned, forgotten. They say Rome was founded on a Lupa's milk but the men who used my mother, the money lender, the ham, the whorer, they abandoned me. Only you loved me, but when the gods took you from me they left me with nothing. Oh, Vesta my mother. I feel your soul within me, your voice in my head, crying for justice. I have taken it for you. Now must that same judgement be passed upon me, your poor boy. Perhaps then, at last, your voice will be quietened.

The sturdiness of our triremes made us proud and kept the pirates' ships at bay.

My fight against the regime is over! This chest held more drachmas than I knew existed. I can start anew. Go somewhere else. Be somebody else. Am I a bad person? I have abandoned my brothers. You, who read this -- what would you have done? If you are a fighter deep down, take my weapon. It has served me well, but I will never wield it again.

Muskephi, I asked you to clean the tops of the pigeon towers three days ago. Get to it already! I know you've been out drinking with your friends. Don't forget to use the rope I gave you, in case you slip on the pigeon shit.

This man was working for Cleopatra. He betrayed Giza. He betrayed my love, Rudjek, and he betrayed the gods. This loot has been cursed. He who touches it touches the sad ka of Minmontu, who is here, taken by Ra. I remain Rudjek's eternal goddess, Suphia.

The Centaur laughed tenderly. “Hidden are the rites of holy love, Phoebus. You came to this mountain to be her husband, and you will bear her over the sea to the choicest garden of Zeus. There will you place a circlet of gold upon her head, and make her the ruler of a city in fair Libya. She will bear your child, honored among his people, they will call him Aristaeus.” Having spoken, Cheiron urged the god to fulfill the delightful consummation of his marriage with the fair hunteress Cyrene.

Akunosh, you won't believe this! I was fishing along the northeastern coast when bandits boiled out of the woods. I hid behind a rock as fast as I could, almost ruined my pants! But I heard them say one of their goons accidently dropped a chest full of valuables in the water, just off the docks! We've got to get it, soon as I'm finished my shift dusting off the temple of all this sand… Again!  
<LF>on't you go without me! We need to be two to bring it out of the water!

<img src='QuestObjective'/> On the effects of the Orb of Siwa

Id: [0x001073E8]
It seems that each man behaves as to the desires of his temperament and the limits of his imagination. I told Kleitos that he was a chicken and he should peck the ground by my feet, instead he believed he could fly and jumped headlong from the temple stairs. The relic does not make you a mindless automaton; instead, it plants within you such a powerful illusion, that you cannot be dissuaded from the truth of it. In the right hands this is an artifact of unimaginable potency.

Id: [0x001073EA]
Melitta, thank you again for your gracious hospitality. But I really don't know how you live amongst the peasants in Balagrae. It seems to me a provincial town full of peasants and hayseeds. It does not even have a proper Roman baths! The wine was decent I suppose, but I attribute that to your excellent taste. Perhaps next time Flavius calls together his council of Kyrenaika, we can meet at my villa for our comissatio? You must try my cook's milk-fed snails!<LF>Your humble servant, Leander

Id: [0x001073EC]
Flavius, first you must know that there are Egyptian spies operating in the region. It is from them that most of our intelligence has been extracted. Caesar's lover, Cleopatra has ambition to make herself Queen of Rome. I would not be surprised if she sails down the Tiber in a barge made of gold! As you witnessed at the Battle of the Nile, her soldiers are mainly composed of hoplites and spearmen, with mounted scouts, heavy cavalry and the hetairoi, her mounted bodyguard. General Agrippa

Melitta. You have been one of my most trusted advisors and so I entrust to the most valuable reward. You are my sole confident of my plans for the future of Rome. The Eternal City will be great again, but Caesar, enamored of that Egyptian viper, has grown weak. He cannot lead us and so the Order of the Ancients will see how I prove my worth to them. I will bring this pathetic backwater to its knees. They will understand what it means to be in the presence of a God. And you will be at my side when they do. <LF>Flavius Metellus

Leander. I know you want my taxes for the year, but I do not have the money. We agreed that I would have at least until the end of the month and that it would be 1000 drachma. Now you want double that! Suddenly Flavius says jump and I must ask how high?

Leander<LF>You asked me to tell you anything I heard. And I heard lots. Simonides talks in his sleep, which is often considering he'll down a keg or two of wine before I even get me hands on his Little Simonides. He murmurs the name Diocles a lot. That's the looker, right? With the flowing dark hair and come-to-bed eyes? Well, I think they are in love, the amount Old Simon dreams of him. Oh, and before I forget, Ipthos fucked a boy behind the baths. <LF>Leto

The sturdiness of our triremes is what keeps enemy ships at bay. The Cypriot timber we use to build these ships is the strongest available in the known world. We are concerned about our access to the wood, as we have not been provided with it regularly since Cicero's son became ruler.

This remarkable blade is said to have slain the Persian tyrant Xerxes, who waged war on Greece and despoiled Egypt itself. Artabanus (who later took the name Darius) constructed the blade using a clever mechanism that allows it to lay hidden within the wearer's sleeve.

Aya's letter

Id: [0x001074C2]
My love Bayek, Caesar has been assassinated.  Septimius is also dead. I have founded a bureau in the middle of Rome, yet no one knows of our existence. Like Amun, we are the hidden ones. The irony of freedom. We are free of each other yet it brings me no happiness. We must move forward. Remain in our tempest of blood poetry. Despite it all we dance and they die. From darkness we have come and in darkness we shall stay. Humans are not meant to last forever. But this Creed will. The Creed is the only immortal thing in the world. Let nothing grieve you beyond measure.  For your life is short, and time will claim its toll.  But I am no longer who I was. I have renounced all love I once had. I have renounced Aya. I have killed Aya. I am now reborn as Amunet.

About the Muses

Id: [0x001074D2]
This library is dedicated to invoke the nine daughters of Zeus, sometimes called the Muses. Recruited by Osiris, they are known as Kalliope, Kleio, Euterpe, Erato, Melpomene, Polyhymnia, Terpsichore, Thalia and Urania. They are the goddesses of arts, key to the good life and the names of Herodotos' Historiai books.

We are victorious. The Divine Lion, the powerful one, whose breath formed the desert, whose tongue is as rough as the sand, whose eyes blaze with the heat of the sun, the fiercest of hunters will swallow this profane place. This city where men professed themselves greater than the gods. We chosen fall towards apotheosis, while our enemies fall in disgrace. The city and all within will lay beneath a blanket of sand for a hundred years. In exchange she will let the rest of the Nile prosper under the God of the Sky.

Understanding Yesterday -- Bettering Tomorrow.  <LF>The Historical Research Division was inspired by the works of Dr. Warren Vidic, a pioneer in the field of genetic memory science.

Historical Research<LF>Modern Day Historians<LF><LF>Abstergo's historians have nothing in common with the Academic Scholars you might be thinking of. They master a deep knowledge of historical tomes and an uncanny ability to successfully comb through the voluminous databases owned by Abstergo. However, they express their true talents when out in the field, retracing what forgotten stories were left behind. Assisted by cutting edge technology, each of our Historical Tactical Team (HTT) is composed of a Technician and a Medical Officer. Together, they gather the knowledge told by forgotten artifacts and extinct bloodlines. They uncover tales thought obsolete, and combine the wisdom of oral history with tomorrow's scientific discoveries.<LF>These see-it-all/find-it-all teams allow Abstergo and all its divisions to push back on the limits of what is known and what can be done to better the future of each and every one of us.

Perhaps the answer is within each and every one of us. The human genome conceals our blueprint but perhaps it contains a lot more. Today, we are exploring genetic memories and we are already applying knowledge acquired thus to improve our performance as individual but, also, as a global society.<LF>Tomorrow, we might explore memories hidden in structures far more obscure than the human and who knows what we'll find.<LF>Such is the task of our medical endeavors. We do not strive to heal the body through a direct cure, but rather we strive to use our understanding of chemistry and biology to change the way we lead our lives. For the better.

Portable Animus FAQ<LF>How to use. How to Help.<LF><LF>1. How do I adjust the portable Animus' settings? <LF>Don't. Under no circumstances should this equipment be tampered with. The Technician must connect to the instrument using the approved procedure only. Their vital signs will then be monitored by the Medical Officer, either locally or remotely. According to the readings, the Medic may suggest course-corrections and/or best use of the medical equipment made available in the Standard-Issue Pharmaceutical Kit to ensure the health and safety of the Animus user.  <LF><LF>2. What is the procedure in case of power failure?<LF>In circumstances where the Portable Animus cannot be connected to a standard power supply, the generator provided in the Technician's equipment offers 5-day autonomy of use with the standard supply of gasoline. If at any time power shortages or failures are observed during Animus use, it is the duty of the Medical Officer to notify the Technician, or to terminate Animus activities until a reliable power supply can be found. The Animus includes a failsafe that prevents serious physical harm to the user.

Id: [0x00107542]
Portable Animus FAQ<LF>How to use. How to Help.<LF><LF>3. How is the Portable Animus activated? <LF>Make sure the device is connected to a power source before attempting to turn it on.<LF>Boot the Animus using the on/off switch. For safety reasons, the Animus OS must run for a minimum of sixty minutes before the Technician initiates the genetic memory sequencing procedure. <LF><LF>This allows the machine's Thermogel to regulate, as well as permitting the Medical Officer to run standard activation procedure and to ensure the stability of the base readings. The Technician should never initiate genetic memory sequencing prior to receiving the “All Clear” status from the Medical Officer. 

<LF>. What is the procedure for managing Animus malfunctions? <LF>In the case of a malfunction, the Medical Officer triggers the ejection protocol, ending the simulation in a manner that is minimally disruptive to the Animus user. After exiting the simulation, the Technician transfers the most recent data to a secure autonomous drive before powering down the Animus. <LF><LF>Teams may not attempt to investigate Animus malfunctions or to repair any part of the machine. If a malfunction compromises the successful completion of a mission, the Technician must immediately inform central dispatch and send a report to their managing officer, who may recommend that the mission be aborted.<LF><LF>As per standard mission protocol, debrief is carried out at the Team's flagship facility. The faulty device is to be returned to the Animus Project Team for evaluation.

William Miles' final messages to his son Desmond. <LF>Miles Senior was in Cairo when Abstergo found him. Looks like Subject 17 busted him out of our Italian facility a few days before he died.

Don't worry

I know you think it's dangerous for me to head to Egypt on my own. And you're probably right. Wouldn't be surprised if Cross is already there. They're looking these things down left and right. But we don`t have a lot of options. If there`s a chance to grab the last power source, we've got to take it.<LF>I promise I'll be careful. I've been figthing these bastards since before you were born. Literally.

Id: [0x00107577]
I'm sorry

Id: [0x00107578]
They're going to be here soon. Trapped me in this damn museum. Should've taken more precautions... I'm sorry, son. It wasn't fair for me to come down on you the way I did. You never asked for any of this, and I should have been more understanding. <LF>I hope you can forgive me.  <LF>I love you.

Id: [0x001075D0]
Introduction<LF><LF>DNA is more than pure genetic information. It also contains zettabytes of factual and historical data which we now call genetic memories. The initial goal of the Animus Project was to explore those genetic memories via virtual reality. Breakthrough discoveries allowed the technology to become a way for Abstergo users to actually interface with history and explore what was once thought lost forever.  <LF><LF>The Animus software is adaptive, so as the memories unfold, the program adapts subtly to render a customized experience within the framework's boundaries. The experience unravels in the user's awareness. It unlocks reflexes and skills the body was unknowingly hiding. <LF><LF>The Animus is a window to the past, a door to the future. Join us as we revisit just how this journey came to be.

<LF>0,000 years ago, strange architectural shapes and humanoids… what on earth is she talking about, and where is the Standish sample today?

Id: [0x001075D9]
Álvaro... I hope you're sitting down. ±±~± ±±±~± was extracted from the Standish sample last week. The total video we have amounts to barely 2.7 seconds at 60 FPS from a total of ~± ±±~±±±±/ memories. But even with this obscure sample, I'm already getting butterflies ±/ ~± ~±±. I pulled one frame from the video to show you how mangled the data is. But even at this quality some striking details emerge:



Note the ~± ±±~<LF>±±~± figures, a full 20 inches taller on average than the humanoids nearby... ±±~± ±±±~±//±±/. The architecture looks like some combination of Sumerian, Egyptian, and Babylonian... but the metals they're using are /±±±~±/±~±± alloys. Elsewhere we see stranger architectural shapes. These structures have no modern precedent anywhere in the world, though the memory's geo-stamp gives us a location south west of the ~± ±±~±±±±±±~± //~±/. Unfortunately, most of the geo-stamps on these images are confusing. 
Some point to a location in m<LF>dern Jordan some 80,000 years ago, other to a few locations in ±±±~­~­±~­ and Ethiopia. But so far, we haven't been able to nail anything down with much precision.

A Nauarchos (admiral) in Cleopatra's navy, Phoxidas was a wealthy owner of a fleet of ships and its crew, who's pledged his loyalty to Cleopatra. He was loyal to Cleopatra's father, although he found Ptolemy Auletes to be a rather boorish man. He was a soldier in his youth, but retired into great wealth and used this money to fund his fleet of ships.

Tahira is almost a force of nature unto herself - she's like the rushing Nile, powerful, impossible to hold back, and always moving forward. Tahirah has left the life of the city - with its corruption and decadence - and has retreated to the wilderness. She is intensely devoted to the old gods, like Sobek (of the Pointed Teeth), and has a strong abhorence for the parasitic invasion of foreign (Roman) powers.

Day 39. Six of my men are dead. Twelve remain, half of whom are on the brink of giving up. But, the gods have perhaps answered my prayers. A grave storm rolled in last night, and it smothered our worksite. I thought it would mark the end. Instead, we woke up to find bones, weapons, and artifacts that had surfaced because of the storm. These could be the remains of the lost army of Cambyses – 50,000 Persians who vanished in the blink of an eye after setting out to destroy the oracle at Siwa almost 500 years ago. This new discovery has breathed some life back into my men and lifted their spirits, but there's no denying that we've been out here far too long. The sun taking its toll, and the friction between the Rebels and Ptolemies is inching closer in this direction. We may have to abandon this site altogether. What a tragedy that would be.

Abstergo Animus Guide - 2. Where it all started

Id: [0x00107715]
Where it all started<LF><LF>It was in Philadelphia, in 1795, that Philip Syng Physick performed the first human blood transfusion in the history of medicine. The idea of transporting blood from one body to another fascinated the distinguished surgeon, but what he found exceeded his expectations.<LF>Fearing the scientific community would not be ready for such revelations, he gave his unpublished paper to his colleague and friend Benjamin Rush. Physick's knowledge was all but lost until Pauling, financed by the Rockefeller Foundation, started researching the restricted archives of The Library Company of Philadelphia, and found the Physick paper that had been secretly preserved by Rush.<LF>Pauling's work on the hemoglobin structure which was loosely borrowed from Physick's lost paper paved the way to his triple and double helix discoveries.

It rivals his earlier work on protein structure.<LF><LF>I believe Abstergo Chemicals should pay special attention to the evolution of DNA science as it will likely unlock the very secrets of life. Please note I would be more than willing to play a more direct role to encourage Dr. Pauling's research efforts if you wish me to.<LF><LF>In the meantime, I wanted to thank you for thrusting me with the business of the Foundation.

The earliest concepts for an Animus prototype came from Abstergo Chemicals and appeared in 1960 under the guise of the “Memorium S-2000”.

Even though the process was painful, it was somewhat safer and showed great promise for the future. Vidic's team at the Abstergo Facility in Philadelphia were able to prove this in 1983 using the latest Animus 1.09 and Subject 4's genetic memories.

Royal Scribe to Ptolemy, Eudoros was one of the puppet-masters of the pharaoh. He met his death in Alexandria's opulent bathhouse thanks to Bayek's newly acquired hidden blade, although he did manage to exact limited vengeance: the loss of Bayek's ring finger. But was Eudoros in fact The Snake?

Taharqa was the mythical Scarab who haunted Sais and Letopolis. A great man who caused terrible pain in pursuit of a quest to build monuments that would outlive him.

Pothinus was among the more restrained members of the Order of Ancients. He favored use of brutality only in the most extreme situations.

Septimius was a loyal soldier in the Order of Ancients and was one of the conspirators who murdered Bayek's son Khemu. Bayek nearly killed the Gabiniani at the Battle of the Nile, but was denied his revenge by Julius Caesar. After this betrayal and the terrible events at Siwa, Aya continues to hunt Septimius down, finally catching up with him in Rome. Septimius was unrepentant, believing that he did his duty to Rome and the order, and would be rewarded in the afterlife.

Id: [0x00107749]
As a high-ranking member of the Order of Ancients Flavius was the murderer of Bayek and Aya's son Khemu. Consumed by madness and a bloodthirsty desire for power, he cut a bloody swath through the Roman province of Kyrenaika with the Oracle's Relic. When Bayek in turn took Flavius' life, the monster showed no remorse for the terrible things he had done. Cold and calculating to the end, he mocked Bayek and expounded the glory of Rome.

After the events at Siwa, the Staff of Alexander was placed into the eager hands of Julius Caesar. But with Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus dead and Caesar's growing influence and power wining hearts and minds, those less enamored of the dictator took action. With the Liberatores Cassius and Brutus, Aya came to Rome and the newly formed Creed had its first target. On the Ides of March, Aya assassinated Caesar in the Senate, little knowing an Empire would arise from his ashes.

More stable than ever before and with greater control over the well-documented Bleeding Effect, the Animus 1.28 was developed by the Abstergo Facility in Philadelphia  2002.<LF><LF><LF>If the design has evolved over the last 10 years, the technology has remained basically the same.<LF> <LF><LF>It's true, few subjects were able to fully experience the simulations, and those who did could only visit their own genetic memories.<LF><LF><LF>The work accomplished by subjects 4 through 17, and later by all the participants in the Animi Training Program, was critical for the development of Animus technology and for all of Abstergo Industries' endeavors.

Based on VR research, the Animus Project Teams realized they could maximize the efficiency of the Animus, and even harness the bleeding effect, where immersion and physicality are combined.<LF>Biotechnologies played a critical role in creating the epidural system used by Aerie Animus. The visceral nature of the experience drove synchronization levels to new heights allowing for a range genetic memory exploration never seen before.  <LF>Instead of trying to contain the bleeding effect, the Aerie unleashes it and uses its potential to blur the lines between the user's reality and the simulation they're engaged in.<LF><LF>The Aerie can only be used in a medically controlled environment.

The Portable Animus HR-8 is Abstergo's latest innovation. It channels the power of the Aerie in a single compact suitcase that allows dedicated professionals to use the unit in the field. Previous operations sometimes required delicate extractions, or placed some genetic memories out of reach.  <LF><LF>With minimal medical support, technicians can now use the system for their own explorations or safely run explorations on selected person of interest, in the comfort of their surroundings.<LF><LF>For safety purposes, the epidural connection has been replaced by a hematological link. It sequences the information stored in the user's red blood cells.  Like any intravenous intervention, the result is fast, intense and intertwined to the user's biological functions. <LF>Just like the Aerie, the simulation is not transmitted to the user's brain. It is physically rendered through the user's organs and interpreted by the brain as being real.

On Culture

It is not without some pride that I observe the steady blooming of high culture across the once barren Faiyum. With every small change my persistent effort, careful planning, and fervent belief in the higher principles is vindicated. It has required a firm hand. Egypt does not relinquish its long barbarism easily. Some would question whether it is worth doing at all. I confess there have been times I have quietly wondered so myself. But looking now across our granary, with the sublime echoes of order calling from every shrub, pillar, and gable, I'm more certain than ever of our course. Whatever the cost, we will bring true civilization to the Faiyum, and then beyond. It is not merely desirable, it is imperative. With or without it's co-operation, all of Egypt will be brought to bear, and order created.

Letter from Eudoros to the Ibis

Esteemed Ibis. The pharaoh remains compliant and is our puppet in all things. Act with caution in Siwa: the murder of the Heron was but the first. Two from among us here in Alexandria have also been killed. However, the situation is under control - Gennadios is actively questioning the populace. We commend your efforts, Ibis. Long life.

Najib, we waited for your return but were forced to press on.

Luck no longer aids us and we must find another way to empty the burial chamber. A few items have been removed but Ptah himself has been angered by our sacrilege.

And then I watched you make the jump into the great unknown.<LF><LF>But the fact is, even after all the insight you've given us, I'm still not sure I can place my trust in you to be part of the Animus Project here in Madrid.<LF>How many sanctions were added to your Operation File after I asked you to respect the boundaries of your assignments? Too many, Layla. Too many.<LF>You have a brilliant mind, but you are also unpredictable. I cannot afford to have a loose cannon in the lab putting the team's progress at risk. It's hard enough to handle the Subjects as it is.<LF><LF>I wish you would put your spirit to greater use. That I could give you a task and know deep down that the next morning I would find you ironing out the details, and not in the lounge rearranging a highly classified piece of code on an unsecured laptop.<LF><LF>Work hard, Layla, and forget about one day moving to the Animus Project. Focus on the challenges of the Historical Research Division, they are tailored for you.  <LF>Perhaps, one day, if you change your ways, I'll reach out again, just as I did in Berkeley.  <LF>But until then, I ask you to respect my decision and stop contacting me.

We'll celebrate whatever it is you wish to celebrate, including the famous secular tradition of not celebrating anything at all if that's what works for you.<LF><LF>My mom will cook some pumpkin pie, my dad will ask us why we won't shoot at rodents, and we'll eat a non-vegan breakfast in a dodgy casino before we spend the day outside snowmobiling.<LF>I love North Dakota, but it could sure use a bit of Layla Hassan.<LF>Say yes.

You sure know how to make a girl happy. Rodents and a dodgy casino… I think I'll pass.
<LF>here's nothing I want more than being with my little “Stone Cold Crazy” machine right now. I've just come up with an idea for the sequencer and I can't get it out of my head.
S<LF> far, it's only a sketch on a dirty placemat, so I have to get busy if I want to test it before I go into retirement, if that ever happens.<LF><LF>Sorry. I'm being an ass. It's a very nice offer, Dee, and I appreciate your concern, but I'll be fine. Don't worry, I always am.<LF><LF>Besides, I promised Hathaway I'd complete my operation reports. I must be 10 or 12 behind, most of them hardly have anything besides our names and the mention “Done”.

<LF>e told me they had to be completed before the end of the year otherwise he would file a formal complaint to operations, which could mean more coaching from the mediator and that is just pure torture.<LF>No. I like the guy, so I'll cut him some slack and get him his reports before he gets to sing Auld Lang Syne.<LF>L.

Dee, <LF>Wow. Why is my head still spinning? I barely had more than a few drinks?<LF>But, I just thought of something. You know how the Animus sequences DNA to run simulations based on genetic memories?<LF>What if (and this might be the fifth Old Fashioned talking here) what if we could actually find a way to do the same through inorganic matter?<LF>Sure, we'd be out of codons, but we'd still have molecular structures to work with.<LF>I mean, it took years for Dr. Vidic to crack genetic memories and once he got to them, he went nuclear on decoding them. What if he stopped too fast? <LF>What if isomers are packed with molecular memories? <LF>Ok, maybe molecules are too big, maybe we need to consider that the information might be stored deep down at the subatomic level. Why would memory latch uniquely onto organic molecules? I mean, I've seen stranger things but somehow I just can't find any plausible reason why it wouldn't.<LF><LF>I wish my middle of the night emails were more about a date I just kicked out or an obnoxious neighbor. Sorry… I guess you're stuck with me.

We began collecting gifts and tribute for the festival but our cart has broken down. One of the nearby priests has graciously offered his villa to use as we await repairs. We depart soon, for if only the people knew the value of the amount we have under this roof, I fear there would be riots!

Id: [0x00107961]
I hope all has gone well and no one has noticed the coin you have taken from the garrison treasury. There is a local farmer who has been convinced to move elsewhere and provide cover while you await passage out of the city. Remain there and out of sight until the ship arrives at the main port and I will send word when it is safe to move out.

Id: [0x00107962]
My dear wife – with all the outsiders and pilgrims arriving in the city for the festival, I made the decision to hire guards to protect your art collection. I hired them on good authority from a merchant that supplies the palace reserves. I am not so sure they are here to keep our home safe and feel I have invited the lions into our home. Ptah, help me to see you again safe!

Id: [0x00107963]
The forgotten temple below Hathor has made an excellent place to worship in secret. With the collapse of the ceiling, several chambers are now open to us where we may continue to praise Sobek without the eyes of Ptah upon us. We must continue to explore the darkness though; some of our priests have not been seen in some time. Perhaps they ran into the city guards…

Id: [0x00107964]
Ptah has spoken – All capable shipbuilders and craftsmen must toil night and day until his ships fill the horizon with their sails! Leave no tree standing until his royal fleet is mighty. Let his navy go forth and keep safe the waters of Egypt along the Nile and the Delta!

Official Complaint

Id: [0x0010796B]
We are writing to protest the unfair taxation now levied upon Egyptians in Soknopaiou Nesos. It seems every second week there is a new tax that only Egyptians must pay, who are least able to afford it. Meanwhile Greeks are exempted, or pay much reduced versions. This inequity between Egyptians and Greeks is reflected in every new law that is made.<LF>As long-time residents of Soknopaiou Nesos we protest the injustice in the strongest terms, and ask that all future laws reflect a balanced, fair distribution of burden. Only then will Egypt truly offer "proserity for all".<LF><LF>Signed the Soknopaiou Nesos Egyptian Merchants Guild.

Wadjet curse these Greeks and their thieving ways! They stole my home out from under me, throwing my family into the fields with nothing. Some filthy pampered noble calls his own the house I built with my hands. The place my son was born! Now I have only this dirty hut.<LF>The politicians cry "prosperity and culture" from their high balconies while Egyptians starve in the streets below them. They are snakes and scorpions smiling in their togas while stealing even the food from our tables. It's time they were all swept from Egypt. With Wadjet's help, that is exactly what will happen.<LF>A curse on every one of the pale devils. Neket iadet!

Treating the Soldiers

We used forceps to try and remove the arrowheads but Julius Oenius had lost too much blood and died before we could remove them. When treating a curable wound there are two things to remember, preventing hemorrhage and avoiding inflammation. Vinegar can staunch the flow of blood. But inflammation is more likely when bone, sinew, cartilage, or muscle is injured. Bandages should be of wide linen to cover in a single turn not only the wound but a little on the edges on both sides.

Id: [0x001079EE]
It is important to have a healthy mind in a healthy body and adhere to the Hippocratic ideal of the focusing on natural treatment to approach the disease. A physician should study anatomy in particular that of the spine and it's relation to the nerves which control all function of the body. It is acceptable to perform dissections on convicted criminals. But if a physician cannot lay his hands upon a cadaver for his studies, animals such as cows and apes can be used.

The sea snails keep themselves concealed for thirty days until the time of the rising of the dog star.

Id: [0x001079F2]
Decius, be careful how you treat the snails for the Tyrian purple is worth a great deal to the Romans. They use it in the production of their ceremonial robes, so we can sell for a vast profit. From the larger ones, it is extracted after taking off the shell; but the small fish must be crushed alive, together with the shells, upon which they eject this the purple secretion. Good luck my friend, I will be back from the festival in two days.

Place the tablets on the walls of the temple, they should show the name of the patient, their ailment, and the prescribed cure. The afflicted should then undergo a cleansing ritual and their receptiveness to the healing powers of the god Asclepius will be aided by fasting, prayer, and sacrifice. If the divine physician does not cure them, tell them that it is because of the lack of faith. Perhaps more drachmae will harden their conviction.

This bridge is graciously given to the people of Kyrenaika by Proconsul Flavius. It will be built by Quintus Cloelius and his crew, the Invincible Ironsides. They are the greatest bridge builders in Rome.

On Road Construction

Id: [0x00107A12]
Tiberius Martialis, I am sending you the fundamentals of road construction, so you and your men may follow them. First you dig the trench and then at the bottom you put a layer of larger stones. On top of that, place broken stones, pebbles, sand and cement to make a firm base. Finally, you must cut the paving stones so that they fit together tightly. I will come check the work when my Dioptra is recovered. Vitruvius.

Id: [0x00107A15]
I give you praise, Divine healer

Id: [0x00107A16]
Phlatolos dedicates this votive to Asclepius and his fair daughter Hygiea as a thank you offering for curing his leg pain.

Id: [0x00107A18]
Galenius. These men deserve a burial, but we cannot afford the time it will take to dig their graves. I considered having each man dig his own so when the work or heat killed them they would have a final resting place, but it seemed unnecessarily cruel, even by Agrippa's standards. So just dig one pit and throw them in. It is all we can spare for these prisoners of Rome.

Id: [0x00107A19]
The Catapults

Id: [0x00107A1A]
General Agrippa, we are nearly finished with the construction of the catapults. It has been made easier by the abundance of hardwood such as oak in the Kyrenaika region. We have also tried to improve a little on the design. We created two coils of rope made from cow sinew. We have also set the spring mechanisms wider apart giving the weapon greater firing accuracy. The Egyptians won't know what hit them... literally.

Id: [0x00107A1B]
My Strategy in Kyrenaika

Id: [0x00107A1C]
Flavius demands that our Kyrenaika Legion be the greatest Rome has seen. My ambitions will not let it be otherwise. Every morning the men will practice with wooden swords and shields, heavier than those used in battle to build up their fortitude. Then make them march twenty miles with a full pack in less than five hours. The five thousand men under my command will be the most disciplined, the strongest, bravest. Only then will we be ready for Flavius' great plan for us. General Agrippa

Id: [0x00107A1D]
Warning about the mixture

Id: [0x00107A1E]
Kade, I am leaving you a warning about the mixture. It is dangerous work and Galeos has already managed to burn himself carrying the quicklime. Stupid fool touched it with his bare hands! The resin is also troublesome. It comes from the silphium plant and impossible to remove if it dries out. So try not to spill any. The Romans also delivered some pitch, the stuff that they use to cover the hulls of their ships to keep the water out. Isis only knows what that is for. Your faithful friend, Tedi.

Id: [0x00107A1F]
By Order of the Proconsul of Cyrene Flavius Metellus

Id: [0x00107A20]
All Egyptians passing through the border must be questioned as to their intentions in the region. It is due to this increased vigilance that we have managed to capture Apollodorus' spies before they can report back with our most prized military secrets and maneuvers. General Agrippa.

Id: [0x00107A21]
A job well done!

Id: [0x00107A22]
Quintus Cloelius, you and your men deserve my highest praise. You have managed to cut down all of the trees within a heredium of the fort in the two days I hoped. This should be more than enough wood to finish the construction of both the walls. We might even be able to extend the officer's quarters! Now enjoy the two bladders of wine I left with the quartermaster. General Agrippa

Id: [0x00107A23]
Great God of the Shining Bow

Id: [0x00107A24]
The people honor the shining one, son of Leto, brother of Artemis, bringer of the sun, Delos' fair Hunter, God of the Lyre, Apollo. It is for him that this city is founded. In his name, in his great and worthy shadow, in his grace, in his light.

Tabitha's Diary

Id: [0x00107A26]
They treat me like I am nothing, infames. But they forget I have ears, eyes… and I hear everything. Every little plot they hatch, the dishonesty and betrayal they call intrigue. Just last week that greasy hog Leander said how much he skims off the top of the city's treasury for his sick parties. He and Flavius, they laughed as he boasted. Only Diocles cares for the people. He comes with his friend Simonides, but sits apart, drinks wine and talks with us. I wish I could make him forget his woes.

Id: [0x00107A2B]
Festival of Dionysus

Id: [0x00107A2C]
The twentieth annual Kyrenaika Dionysia. Citizens of Cyrene come join us for the Festival of Dionysus in the Theater of Apollo. Our greatest actor Metrobius will perform a tragedy of his own composition on the twelve labors of Herakles. He himself will play the demigod. There will also be a satyr play penned by the magistrate Simonides on the theme of Perseus, called Kraken Released.

Id: [0x00107A2D]
Dedicated to the Darting King

Id: [0x00107A2E]
Here did the sunlit one, the beauteous, shining Apollo Karneios, the god of the ram, take the Great Huntress, the nymph's daughter Cyrene. And a spring burst forth from the consummation of their union.

Hekate, Hear my Prayer

Id: [0x00107A36]
The journey was perilous, but we have arrived. The summit has become savage. At night, we heard wild dogs howling and one day a lion stalked us until Idas chased it away with a stick. But now we can really begin to honor our teacher. We need nothing but good company and lively discussion and if that runs out, we have a bladder of wine. Nothing can dull my excitement for we are the birth of something that will outlive us all. Your loving son, Phe'sho.

A Poetic Lament

Id: [0x00107A40]
I watch the poppies, and sadness consumes me. They bloom in their time, then fade and die. The bees burn happily through their little lives, making sweetness before they go. Everything has a time, and a purpose. But where is mine?<LF>There is no husband for me. All the men were killed or fled, and we are left with no future. There is no hope for marriage, for love, and for children.<LF>My time is passing, I feel it. My body will wither with the years and the loneliness. Soon I will be old, and empty, and bitter. Oh what a cruel fate!<LF>Ptah look upon me, and hear my prayer! Make my life fruitful! Bring me a husband. Don't let me fade like a poppy that never blooms!

Fuck Culture for All!

Id: [0x00107A42]
Culture for all! What a fucking joke! They make everything Greek, and remove anything Egyptian. They replace our culture with their own and call it new. Culture for all means Greek culture, and only Greek culture. Well I see through their lies. Fuck Greece, and fuck their filthy culture.

Goodbye Philadelphia

Id: [0x00107A46]
It pains me to go, but I have no choice. I must find my husband and bring him back to his senses. I knew those Wadjet cultists were trouble, but I had no idea how much he had been affected by their cult. I thought it was just going to be a passing interest, like so many others before it. How wrong I was!<LF>I hate to leave this place. It is my home, and it took years to accumulate all my beautiful Faiyum portraits. But I love my husband more, and it is my duty to do what I can to restore him. I pray whoever lives in this villa after us loves it as much as we did. May it bring them better fortune than it brought us.

Remember Our Purpose

Id: [0x00107A48]
We are not smugglers. We are not thieves. We are taking back what rightfully belongs to us.<LF>Yes, we acquire artifacts from Ptolemy. <LF>But these are Egyptian artifacts that belong to Egypt. <LF>Our profits feed Egyptian mouths in Egyptian slums, not the fat faces of greedy Greeks in their pretentious decorated villas.<LF>Remember our purpose, and do not get distracted by subtle Greek lies.<LF>Ptahshepses, Chief Merchant, Valley Market

A Bloated Corpse

Id: [0x00107A4A]
Faiyum is doomed. All of us farmers will be out of jobs by the end of the year.<LF>So I've been thinking, and I've decided to be an explorer instead! This is so exciting! It beats the mundane boredom of farming, that's for sure. I should have done it years ago.<LF>I'm going to start with the cave I used to go to with my brothers when we were children. But nekt, it's flooded this time of the year!<LF>Never mind. I'll just be careful.

Commendation from the Nomarch of Faiyum

Id: [0x00107A4E]
By the grace of Ptolemy The Father-loving God and your hard work, this dam now stands resolute against the desert. Millions depend upon Faiyum's farms, and Faiyum's farmers depended upon you. You prevailed, and I commend you for your efforts.<LF>Prosperity for All. Culture for All. Security for All.

Vultures, by Peneus the Explorer

Id: [0x00107A50]
It is with great pride that I can confirm Vultures do not eat live animals. For the purposes of proving this, I have stayed motionless for days at a time with my faithful dog always beside me (whom I have trained to be still for long periods of time, without even panting or scratching). <LF>My courageous attempts to document wildlife in Faiyum will not go unnoticed, I am certain. My careful records will one day make it into the Great Library of Alexandria. There, they will be kept in safekeeping for millennia. Knowing this makes all my efforts worthwhile.<LF>Peneus the Explorer

Id: [0x00107A51]
Watcher's Report

Id: [0x00107A52]
There has been a noticeable increase in the number and movement of Ptolemy's forces. It appears they are preparing for some kind of attack. Do they intend to target us here? If so, why now? Neither we nor any of the other bandit camps have had conflict with soldiers for months now. It doesn't make sense. I need more information, and will keep watching.

Id: [0x00107A53]
Hail of Arrows

Id: [0x00107A54]
A devastating rain of arrows fell  here. It looks like Ptolemy soldiers attacked these bandits.

I'm in the shit now. That stupid woman couldn't keep her mouth shut, and her husband knows about us. Why couldn't she keep quiet! He's a Captain! What did she think was going to happen? Forgiveness all around? The bastard is going to send his entire garrison after us now, all because she wanted to clear her conscience. My men are going to kill me when they find out!

Thus the motto was born.

The Crocodile's Jaws

Id: [0x00107E67]
Bayek remains on the trail of The Crocodile, who is clearly using Gladiators to carry out their dirty work.

Id: [0x00107E68]
Faiyum's populace is enthralled by the Gladiatorial ring, but the stars of the Arena are busy in the shadows, and Bayek must dive head first into the world of warriors and corruption alongside an old friend from Siwa, Kensa. Will the Crocodile show its teeth?

Id: [0x00107E69]
The Lizard's Face

Id: [0x00107E6A]
Bayek must help the High Priest finally rip the Order of Ancients out of Memphis.

Id: [0x00107E6B]
Memphis' curses are lifted, but the source of them still remains in the Great Temple: The Lizard. With Cleopatra arriving to rally the Egyptians to her name and rightful throne, Bayek and Aya must take out the Lizard, a rotten priest at the core of Memphis. With the Lizard out of the way, joy and festivities may occur without an oppressive cloud overhead.

It worked!

Id: [0x00107ED1]
It worked! I mean, the side effects suck, but my portable Animus is up and running! See what I did, Sofia? <LF><LF>So. I don't know how long I was in there, but it was long enough. But I think this, what was it again, Medjay (like a cop or sheriff? note to self: look this up, find a good description), Bayek, could be a member of this brotherhood of assassins, same as the other subjects Abstergo has been studying. <LF><LF>List of things so far:<LF>• The man is just about as stubborn as I am.<LF>• He's good at talking to people, and fighting too.<LF>• People see him as a protector and defender. <LF>• His community admires and respects him.<LF>• He's a shadow when it comes to not being seen.<LF><LF>Yeah, I guess he fits the profile in part, but I wonder. He's got the tortured soul thing down pat, hell-bent on vengeance and all that stuff. He's got his own thing going on. I could feel it as though it were me. Which I guess it was for a while. This is so weird. His feelings… so much anger, sadness and hate. So much guilt. 
<LF>Anyway. I need more information.<LF><LF>Aya. I remember that name coming up. I remember the flutter in Bayek's stomach when he heard it. Maybe she's the answer.<LF><LF>Only one way to find out. Dee's gonna love this.

Id: [0x00107F04]
This is amazing

Id: [0x00107F05]
Wow. Good thing the animus comes loaded with beta-blockers or my head would be pounding. Dee keeps fussing over my numbers like a little old granny but holy shit, what a trip! It's like being high on sand and history books!<LF><LF>Better start listing some details about these history dives before I babble on for three more pages. I could.<LF><LF>List stuff:<LF>• The civil war between Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII. Front row seats. Never was that much of a history buff, but I'm starting to get it now! This is going to be something. And, gushing again. #sorrynotsorry<LF>• A bit more seriously though, that hidden blade ritual. I remember some of that from the documents I technically never read at all, nope sir, not little old me… it all seems pretty related to Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad and the whole blade of the assassin thing. I bet you that particular ritual the files described originated from the Egyptian one I just witnessed. Lived. Lived it!
<LF> The Snake is dead. They think they killed everyone responsible for Khemu's death.<LF>• Aya and Bayek. They're trying to move on from their son's death, but they're also totally into getting vengeance. The latter isn't gonna help with the former. Also, I can't help but think the sharks are gonna keep getting bigger.<LF><LF>Yeah, I'm just going to talk to myself out loud and gush some more.

Id: [0x00107F06]
Déjà vu, much?

Id: [0x00107F07]
Cleopatra. Polished and perfect and so in control. I don't like her. I get why people were so enraptured with her, she's got enough presence to stop a charging hippo in its tracks, but I just don't like her. Maybe it's because she reminds me of Sofia. I was so stupid and trusting, and she just –  
<LF>Right. So. The past mirroring of real life issues aside…
<LF>• What kind of bad guys call themselves The Order? Could you be any more obvious? Ugh. Though, I gotta wonder. I wonder if they're still around today? (Note to self: look into this.)<LF>• Aya and Bayek. Yeah, I don't think reuniting with Aya is going to be as simple as Bayek thinks. They love each other, that's obvious, but there's way more going on here…
<LF> The feather ritual. I remember reading about that, the weighing of the heart, Anubis, and the Duat. Bayek is collecting Senu's feathers, trying to balance out his own sins. (Research note: Altaïr means eagle – wonder if it's related, or am I just reaching here?) 
<LF> Okay then. Last but not least, the four targets… I may not like Cleopatra, but damn, those rat bastards deserve what's coming to them. What they're doing – I mean, were doing. It was horrible. I'm kinda looking forward to seeing what happens to them. In a ghoulish, historical study sort of way. 

<LF>nly I'm going to be living it. Yeah, definitely ghoulish. Good thing these notes of mine aren't part of any official Abstergo documentation. The shrinks would have a field day with them if I added them to my debriefs. I do not want to end up in a one on one with Otso Berg, thank you very much.

All we wanted to do was try and help people. Work on something useful. Then… Dee. I can't – I can't stop now. Gotta keep moving, keep doing something or else it'll be for nothing.

<LF> need to get to the end of this fast. Abstergo's catches me and it's 1) lock me down for what I know, 2) wipe my brain and let me go, or 3) kill me. I'm guessing 1 or 3 at this point.  What I've learned so far is enough to start my own damned lab, no way are they letting me get away.<LF><LF>I have to keep going. Focus on what I have learned so far… 
<LF>• Bayek still hasn't found whoever actually murdered his son.<LF>• But he's dismantling the Order. Good for him. They have it coming.<LF>• Along the way, Bayek and Aya have been saving a lot of people. Some of them even want to come on to help fight off that Order. It's smart, means they were all working together, not apart. <LF>• I feel like a lot of the stuff I'm seeing is close to the Brotherhood, but the Medjay were public figures. Not sure where it all ties in yet.<LF><LF>I guess back then all you needed was a common cause and an eagle to get the word out and you could set up a revolution. Wish I had a – but no. Me… I'm on my own now, aren't I? Dee… like all those other people in my Gone Files. Dee is dead.

I<LF>m going to keep digging. For Dee. I'm going to find out everything.

The damned headaches are getting harder to ignore. The nausea is worse, but if I stop pushing I know I'll miss something. I wish…
<LF>Bayek and Aya. They did all that work for Cleo, and what do they get? Left with a target on their backs. Well, I know how they feel.<LF><LF>They're not going to take it lying down. And neither am I. <LF><LF>But alone? Even Bayek and Aya ended up founding an organization to fight the Order. The Brotherhood. They had tools. An eagle, a blade. And people sharing the same ideals, wanting to fight the big bad to protect the innocent. That's how the Creed came to be.<LF><LF>We all lost someone we loved… 
<LF>I may not be at the lofty ideals point yet, but Dee didn't die for nothing. I'll make sure of that. I know a lot of Abstergo's secrets. <LF><LF>Guess we just found out what'll make me cooperate with others, eh Sofia? I'm done trying to proving myself. Now I just gotta find my own to fight with. <LF><LF>Somehow.

My tech is working. <LF><LF>I… maybe there is more than I ever thought there was. To everything.
<LF>Type slow. Can do this.<LF><LF>• Those orbs. The Staff. Wonder if that's got anything to do with those messages Bayek found, with the recordings. (See: The Empirical Truth files.)<LF>• Need to figure out, there's something about ‘em.

I'd make fun of myself, like I was watching some stupid soap opera, but I'm living this. I'm sad for Dee and for me and for them and it makes no sense.<LF><LF>Bayek and Aya are breaking up. <LF><LF>I'd yell and shout about but - I know what they're both feeling. This is shit. I literally lived both sides of the story.<LF><LF>Aya knew. I think she'd figured out something like this was going to happen since Khemu died. But Bayek. He really thought he could fix things. You can't fix your kid dying, Bayek. No one can fix that. Nothing can. <LF><LF>Aya's doing what she's chosen to do. Bayek's doing what he has to do. I wonder if this is the moment Abstergo was looking for. It's a lynchpin in time. I'm angry and sad, but this is it. This is why it all started. <LF><LF>An innocent died. <LF><LF>Here are some stupid notes, to go with all those stupid feelings:<LF>• Aya is going to Rome. Brutus and Cassius are going to help her build up an organization there.<LF>• She's going take out Caesar and Septimius. They have it coming.<LF>• An assassin bureau. It'll be founded in Rome. Because of Aya's mission.<LF>• They call themselves the Hidden Ones. Assassins. They're the Brotherhood. That's it.<LF><LF>I am so tired. This happened ages ago and I'm so so - <LF><LF>I miss you, Dee.

I will join you in Herakleion as soon Phoxidas and I finish with our naval missions. I love you more than ever, Bayek.

Medjay Badge

Id: [0x00108274]
The Medjay are the ancient protectors of Egypt and its Pharaohs. An elite warrior unit formed during the Old Kingdom, they are emblematic of true duty, honor and ferocity. Their badge, the eye of Horus, belongs to those tasked with the protection of the Pharaoh's people. As they were also the most trusted guards to the Pharaoh, the Medjay are the ultimate protector of both the Gods and the people.

Id: [0x00108275]
Golden Medjay Badge

Id: [0x00108276]
Cleopatra understands what a Medjay's oldest duty is: to serve a Pharaoh, a true and just leader appointed by the Gods themselves. She believes she is true pharaoh of Egypt and in serving her, one serves the true Egypt. She intends to bring the Medjay back into the Royal fold, as the Ptolemies have phased them out over the past few centuries. Her badge represents the licence to kill on behalf of the Gods and Goddesses of Egypt, political immunity, and a right to enforce the law above that of mortals. It symbolizes the battle against the Order of Ancients.

Letter from Otis

Id: [0x0010877B]
“Medjay Bayek, may Amun guide this letter to your hands.
<LF>    I labor as a scribe within the Royal Palace and have come across some disturbing information. It seems that Siwa is again in danger. The details have eluded me, but some artefacts seem to have attracted the attention of a Roman general at the Saragina Camp. He has begun bribing various Siwan officials in preparation to commandeer the entire village. <LF>     Siwa is dear to me, as a young boy I journeyed there with my parents to pray to the Oracle. I have mourned for its recent travails and would hate to see another visited so soon upon that lovely region. <LF>      I am still attempting to discover the motive behind all this. The information I have was given to me by a Nabatean by the name of Gamilat. It is possible you’ll learn more at the Saragina Camp.
<LF>     If, indeed, you do undertake to prevent the massacre, please meet me afterwards at my home south of the Eastern market in Alexandria.<LF>      Let us pray it is not too late.<LF>             Otis”

“My Egyptian friends,
<LF>ou are well aware that your country is falling into decrepitude. It lacks discipline, it lacks order, it lacks a leader.<LF>Cleopatra does not have the political will to use the required force. It is left to us. We must infiltrate deeply every level of the society. <LF>Adras, as captain of the army, you role will be to conquer Siwa. It is well known that some object of great power is hidden there. We must find it.<LF>Jibade, use your political influence to expand the ranks of the army. We will need many soldiers in the coming months. Pissa Oros citadel is already aware of your arrival.<LF>I have also ordered several carts to be filled with luxurious goods to be used as inducements. One will be waiting for you in Pissa Oros. Another is in preparation at the Limestone Quarry and the last one should leave Camp Menouthis for Alexandria soon . I leave it to you to determine whom to bribe.<LF>I count on you both.<LF>        General R”

Otis's Notes

Id: [0x00108801]
I hope you won't have to read this, because if you do, it means I'm probably dead.<LF>I'm in too deep and I've compromised myself. I do believe I've found what this is all about and it's bigger than I had imagined. An ambitious Roman General named Rufio plans to create a network of Egyptian and Greek collaborators throughout the country. Their goal is to present Rufio as a savior and not a conqueror in order to invade Egypt from within. Fortunately, if you've taken out his allies already, you've cut his most valuable Egyptian connections. He most likely will not abandon his quest...who knows what he'll try next. Please tell Aya I've repaid my debt to her. I wish we could have met you and I.<LF>Otis

Id: [0x00108802]
The name of the mysterious Roman general behind the attack on the fortress is Rufio. <LF>He was an acolyte of Caesar’s and is now attempting to manipulate power in the shadows of Cleopatra and Marc Antony. He considers their rule as too lax. 
<LF>e hopes to strengthen his grip on all of Egypt using an object of some sort that may or may not be found in Siwa.<LF>In addition to Siwa, he has designs on the Sinai Peninsula. A rebel leader there named Gamilat has given me proof of this.<LF>It is my hope that Siwa will be spared from General Rufio’s wickedness …

I need time to get away before Thanasis comes looking for me.<LF>You'll get the rest of the money at our meeting place. Have a cart and rations ready there.<LF>I'm counting on you.<LF> - Kosey
